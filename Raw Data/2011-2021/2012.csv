This work explores the specific tradeoffs that occur between achievable bot recruitment rates and overall botnet stealthiness within P2P structured botnets. It is shown that rapid recruitment of nodes (or bots) leads directly to an order of magnitude increase in the botnet's generated network traffic, which makes the botnet significantly more visible (and susceptible) to defensive counter-measures. Kademlia is used through out this work as the exemplar P2P protocol as, within the real-world, Kademlia has proven to provide an effective C&C mechanism for a number of the longer-lived botnets. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Botnets; Command and control; DDoS Attack; Direct control; Global Security; Kademlia; Network traffic; P2P protocols; Peer to peer; Recruitment rates; Commerce; Internet; Distributed computer systems",,,,,"Holz, T., Steiner, M., Dahl, F., Biersack, E., Freiling, F., Measurements and mitigation of peer-to-peer-based botnets: A case study on storm worm (2008) Proceedings of the 1st Usenix Workshop on Large-Scale Exploits and Emergent Threats, pp. 9:1-9:9. , http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1387709.1387718, ser.

Especially, in an adversarial environment, various kinds of attacks become possible if malicious anchor nodes could claim fake locations that are different from their physical locations. In this paper, we propose an attack-resistant localization algorithm for WSNs to stand against the malicious anchor nodes. First, we use the consistency-based trust evaluation to identify and filter out the malicious anchor nodes. Then, the sensor nodes locations are estimated by a Taylor-series least squares method with combination. Simulation results show that the algorithm can detect compromised anchor nodes effectively and greatly improve the localization accuracy.

Among these research studies, the accuracy and delay of trustworthiness decision are both important problems. In this paper, we propose a road-side unit (RSU) and beacon-based trust management model, called RaBTM, which aims to prorogate message opinions quickly while thwart internal attackers to send or forwarding forged messages in privacy-enhanced VANETs. To evaluate the reliability and efficiency of the proposed system, we conducted a set of simulations under alteration attacks and bogus message attacks with various adversary ratios. The simulation results show that the proposed RaBTM is highly resilient to adversarial attacks and performs at least 20% better than weighted vote (WV) scheme. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media.","RSU-aided; Safety; Trust; VANET","Efficiency improvement; Internal attacker; Location privacy; Message attack; Research studies; RSU-aided; Trust; Trust management model; VANET; Accident prevention; Electrical engineering; Mathematical techniques; Management",,,,,"(2005) Vehicle Safety Communications Project Task 3 Final Report: Identify Intelligent Vehicle Safety Applications Enabled by DSRC, , The CAMP Vehicle Safety Communications Consortium: National HighwayTraffic Safety Administration; Lin, X., Lu, R., Zhang, C., Zhu, H., Ho, P., Shen, X., Security in vehicular ad hoc networks (2008) IEEE on Communications Magazine, 46, pp. 88-95; Dotzer, F., Fischer, L., Magiera, P., VARS: A Vehicle Ad-Hoc Network Reputation System (2005) Proceedings of the Sixth IEEE International Symposium on World of Wireless Mobile and Multimedia Networks, pp. 454-456. , IEEE Computer Society; Ostermaier, B., Dotzer, F., Strassberger, M., Enhancing the Security of Local Danger Warnings in VANETs - A Simulative Analysis of Voting Schemes (2007) Proceedings of the the Second International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security, pp. 422-431. , IEEE Computer Society, Vienna; Wu, Q., Domingo-Ferrer, J., Gonzaìlez-Nicolaìs, U.R., Balanced Trustworthiness, Safety, and Privacy in Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communications (2010) IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 59, pp. 559-573; Lo, N.-W., Tsai, H.-C., A Reputation System for Traffic Safety Event on Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (2009) EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking, 2009; Raya, M., Papadimitratos, P., Gligor, V.D., Hubaux, J.-P., On Data-Centric Trust Establishment in Ephemeral Ad Hoc Networks (2008) The 27th Conference on Computer Communications, IEEE INFOCOM 2008, Phoenix, AZ, pp. 1238-1246; Aifeng, W., Jianqing, M., Shiyong, Z., RATE: A RSU-Aided Scheme for Data-Centric Trust Establishment in VANETs (2011) 2011 7th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing (WiCOM), pp. 1-6; Wei, Y.-C., Chen, Y.-M., Shan, H.-L., Beacon-based trust management for location privacy enhancement VANETs (2011) 2011 13th Asia-Pacific on Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS), Taipei, Taiwan, pp. 1-8; Abdrabou, A., Weihua, Z., Probabilistic Delay Control and Road Side Unit Placement for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks with Disrupted Connectivity (2011) IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 29, pp. 129-139; Chen, T.M., Venkataramanan, V., Dempster-Shafer theory for intrusion detection in ad hoc networks (2005) IEEE on Internet Computing, 9, pp. 35-41; Li, W., Joshi, A., Outlier Detection in Ad Hoc Networks Using Dempster-Shafer Theory (2009) Proceedings of the 2009 Tenth International Conference on Mobile Data Management: Systems, Services and Middleware, , IEEE Computer Society; Aslam, B., Park, S., Zou, C., Turgut, D., Secure Traffic Data Propagation in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (2010) Int.

Crowdsourcing results remains unreliable, however, as those platforms neither convey much information about the workers' identity nor do they ensure the quality of the work done. Instead, it is the responsibility of the requester to filter out bad workers, poorly accomplished tasks, and to aggregate worker results in order to obtain a final outcome. In this paper, we first review techniques currently used to detect spammers and malicious workers, whether they are bots or humans randomly or semi-randomly completing tasks; then, we describe the limitations of existing techniques by proposing approaches that individuals, or groups of individuals, could use to attack a task on existing crowdsourcing platforms.

However, throughout the variety of research works in this topic, most interests focused purely on the localization scheme itself rather than the security issue of the localization. In this paper, we propose a new and original secure version of AT-Dist, a distance-based multihop localization algorithm previously explored but under a non-adversarial environment. This version, called SecAT-Dist, proposes a lightweight security scheme that combines RC4-based hash function and symmetric encryption system to enable sensor nodes to authenticate received beacon location information and protects hop-count information from being arbitrary or selfishly changed. Furthermore, we introduce a trust model based on a set of confidence index taking benefits from specific characteristics of distance-based multihop localization algorithms. Analytically, we show that the number of trust anchors, among the total number including malicious anchors, is reduced. Simulation results show that our security scheme is more resistant to external attacks and allows great number of nodes to be located with accuracy. © 2012 IEEE.","Localization; Security; WSN","Lightweight securities; Localization; Localization schemes; Location-aware application; Multi-hop localizations; Security; Symmetric encryption; WSN; Hash functions; Sensor nodes",,,,,"Jadliwala, M., Zhong, S., Upadhyaya, S., Qiao, C., Member, S., Pierre Hubaux, J., Secure distance-based localization in the presence of cheating beacon nodes (2010) IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, 9 (6), pp. 810-823; Lazos, L., Poovendran, R., Serloc: Secure range-independent localization for wireless sensor networks (2004) Proceedings of the 3rd ACM Workshop on Wireless Security, WiSe '04, pp. 21-30. , New York, NY, USA, ACM; Lazos, L., Poovendran, R., Hirloc: High-resolution robust localization for wireless sensor networks (2006) IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 24 (2), pp. 233-246; Misra, S., Xue, G., Bhardwaj, S., Secure and robust localization in a wireless ad hoc environment (2009) IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 58 (3), pp. 1480-1489; Saad, C., Benslimane, A., König, J.-C., At-dist: A distributed method for localization with high accuracy in sensor networks (2008) Stud.

Jamming can easily disrupt a sensor application such as border monitoring. Since the area being jammed often tells the location of adversarial activities, e.g., illegal border crossing, it is critical to detect jamming efficiently and timely. It has been shown that the packet delivery ratio (PDR) is an effective indicator of jamming attacks. However, energy efficiency and detection timeliness are two conflicting requirements in existing PDR-based schemes. This paper proposes a novel jamming detection approach that is both efficient in terms of the additional overhead and timely in terms of the detection latency. The idea is to conduct two-phase detection. The first phase identifies the sign of jamming quickly and efficiently without adding any extra communication or requiring any special hardware or infrastructure. Any sign of jamming will trigger the second phase detection, which performs a short burst of channel probing to make an accurate decision. The benefits of the two-phase approach are analyzed in the paper. In addition, this paper also presents the detailed evaluation via experiments on a network of TelosB motes. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Border crossings; Border monitoring; Detection approach; Detection latency; Detection timeliness; Packet delivery ratio; Sensor applications; Wireless communications; Energy efficiency; Sensors; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Jamming",,,,,"Cagalj, M., Capkun, S., Hubaux, J.P., Wormhole-based antijamming techniques in sensor networks (2007) IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing (TMC), 6. , Jan; Çakiroǧlu, M., Özcerit, A.T., Jamming detection mechanisms for wireless sensor networks (2008) Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Scalable Information Systems, InfoScale '08, pp. 4:1-4:8; Hu, Y.C., Perrig, A., Johnson, D.B., Packet leashes: A defense against wormhole attacks in wireless ad hoc networks Proceedings of INFOCOM, April 2003; Li, M., Koutsopoulos, I., Poovendran, R., Optimal jamming attacks and network defense policies in wireless sensor networks (2007) IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM), pp. 1307-1315. , May; Liu, D., Protecting neighbor discovery against node compromises in sensor networks Proceedings of the International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS), June 2009; Liu, D., Ning, P., Multi-level μTESLA: Broadcast authentication for distributed sensor networks (2004) ACM Transactions in Embedded Computing Systems (TECS), 3 (4); Newsome, J., Shi, R., Song, D., Perrig, A., The sybil attack in sensor networks: Analysis and defenses Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN 2004), Apr 2004; Parno, B., Perrig, A., Gligor, V., Distributed detection of node replication attacks in sensor networks IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, May 2005; Perrig, A., Szewczyk, R., Wen, V., Culler, D., Tygar, D., SPINS: Security protocols for sensor networks Proc.

The key challenge in such systems is the propagation of erroneous data from a single corrupted node to the rest of the system during a node repair process. This paper presents a concatenated coding scheme which is based on two types of codes: maximum rank distance (MRD) code as an outer code and optimal repair maximal distance separable (MDS) array code as an inner code. Given this, two different types of adversarial errors are considered: the first type considers an adversary that can replace the content of an affected node only once; while the second attack-type considers an adversary that can pollute data an unbounded number of times. This paper proves that the proposed coding scheme attains an upper bound on resilience capacity for the first type of error. Further, the paper presents mechanisms that combine this code with subspace signatures to achieve error resilience for the second type of errors. Finally, the paper concludes by presenting a construction based on MRD codes for optimal locally repairable scalar codes that can tolerate adversarial errors. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Concatenated coding; Distributed storage; Distributed storage system; Erroneous datum; Error resilience; Maximal distance separable; Maximum rank distance codes; Rank-metric codes; Coding errors; Communication; Digital storage; Multiprocessing systems; Optimization; Repair; Optimal systems",,,,,"Dimakis, A.G., Godfrey, P., Wainwright, M., Ramachandran, K., Network coding for distributed storage system (2010) IEEE Trans.

The effectiveness of our solutions is validated on various types of networks with different topology structures. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Critical links; Critical networks; Disruptive event; Dynamic network; Network vulnerability; Re-computing; Topology structure; Adaptive algorithms; Military communications; Topology; Uncertainty analysis; Network security",,,,,"http://networkx.lanl.gov/reference/generated/networkx.generators. random_graphs.barabasi_albert_graph.html; Albert, R., Albert, I., Nakarado, G.L., Structural vulnerability of the north american power grid (2004) Phys.

The combination framework allows to dynamically determine the best IDSs performed in different segments of a dataset. Moreover, to increase the accuracy and reliability of the intrusion detection results, the fusion between outputs of the four IDSs is taken into account by a new expanded framework.

The main challenge lies in finding a robust learning model that is insensitive to unpredictable malicious data distribution. In this paper, we present a sparse relevance vector machine ensemble for adversarial learning. The novelty of our work is the use of individualized kernel parameters to model potential adversarial attacks during model training. We allow the kernel parameters to drift in the direction that minimizes the likelihood of the positive data. This step is interleaved with learning the weights and the weight priors of a relevance vector machine. Our empirical results demonstrate that an ensemble of such relevance vector machine models is more robust to adversarial attacks.© 2012 IEEE.","Adversarial learning; Kernel parameter learning; Relevance vector machine; Spare Bayesian learning","Adversarial learning; Bayesian learning; Data distribution; Data mining tasks; Kernel parameter; Model potential; Model training; Positive data; Relevance Vector Machine; Robust learning; Sparse bayesian; Data mining; Face recognition; Vectors",,,,,"Kearns, M., Li, M., Learning in the presence of malicious errors (1993) SIAM J. of Computing, 22, pp. 807-837; Auer, P., Cesa-Bianchi, N., On-line learning with malicious noise and the closure algorithm (1998) Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, 23 (1-2), pp. 83-99; Tipping, M.E., Sparse Bayesian learning and the relevance vector machine (2001) J.

More specifically, we model the interactions between a network operator and an adversary as a two player zero-sum game, where the network operator chooses a spanning tree in the network, the adversary chooses an edge to be removed from the network, and the adversary's payoff is proportional to the number of nodes that can no longer reach a designated node through the spanning tree. We show that the payoff in every Nash equilibrium of the game is equal to the reciprocal of the persistence of the network. We describe optimal adversarial and operator strategies and give efficient, polynomial-time algorithms to compute optimal strategies.

We model the adversarial nature of the problem as a 2-player game between a network manager who chooses a spanning tree of the network as communication infrastructure and an attacker who is trying to disrupt the communication by attacking a link. We use previously proposed models for the value of a network to derive payoffs of the players and propose the network's expected loss-in-value as a metric for vulnerability. In the process, we generalize the notion of betweenness centrality: a metric largely used in Graph Theory to measure the relative importance of a link within a network. Furthermore, by computing and analyzing the Nash equilibria of the game, we determine the actions of both the attacker and the defender. The analysis reveals the existence of subsets of links that are more critical than the others. We characterize these critical subsets of links and compare them for the different network value models. The comparison shows that critical subsets depend both on the value model and on the connectivity of the network. © 2012 ICST Institute for Computer Science, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","Betweenness Centrality; Critical Links; Nash Equilibrium; Spanning Tree; Value of Communication Network; Vulnerability Metric","Betweenness centrality; Critical links; Nash equilibria; Spanning tree; Vulnerability Metric; Computer games; Game theory; Graph theory; Parallel architectures; Telecommunication networks; Network security",,,,,"Stavridis, J., (2006) Channeling David Sarnoff, , http://www.aco.nato.int/saceur/channeling-david-sarnoff.aspx, USN Admiral September; Boyd, S., Vandenberghe, L., (2004) Convex Optimization, , Cambridge University Press March; Briscoe, B., Odlyzko, A., Tilly, B., Metcalfe's Law isWrong (2006) IEEE Spectrum, pp. 26-31. , July; (2007) Reeds Law States That Social Networks Scale Exponentially, , http://marketingconversation.com/2007/08/28/reeds-law/, August; (2008) A Short Discussion on Metcalfe's Law for Social Networks, , http://marketingconversation.com/2007/08/28/reeds-law/, May; Freeman, L., Centrality in Social Networks Conceptual Clarification (1979) Social Networks, 1 (3), pp. 215-239; Gilder, G., (1995) Metcale's Law and Legacy, , http://www.seas.upenn.edu/gaj1/metgg.html, November; Gueye, A., (2011) A Game Theoretical Approach to Communication Security, , PhD dissertation, University of California, Berkeley, Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences March; Gueye, A., Marbukh, V., Walrand, J.C., (2011) Towards a Quantification of Communication Network Vulnerability to Attacks: A Game Theoretic Approach, , http://www.nist.gov/itl/math/cctg/assane.cfm, Technical report, National Institute of Standards and Technology December; Gueye, A., Walrand, J.C., Anantharam, V., Design of Network Topology in an Adversarial Environment (2010) LNCS, 6442, pp. 1-20. , Alpcan, T., Buttyán, L., Baras, J.S.

A scenario with three correlated sources is considered in which at most one source is compromised by an adversary. The theoretical minimum achievable sum-rate for this scenario was derived by Kosut and Tong. We design layered LDPC convolutional codes for this problem, assuming that one of the sources is available at the common decoder as side information. We demonstrate that layered LDPC convolutional codes constitute a sequence of nested codes where each sub-code is capacity-achieving for the binary symmetric channels used to model the correlation between sources, and therefore, can ideally achieve the theoretical minimum sum-rate. Simulated performance results for moderate block length show a small gap to the theoretical limit, and as the block length increases the gap vanishes. © 2012 IEICE Institute of Electronics Informati.",,"Binary symmetric channel; Block lengths; Code designs; Correlated sources; LDPC convolutional codes; Nested codes; Side information; Simulated performance; Small gaps; Sum-rate; Theoretical limits; Theoretical minimum; Information theory",,,,,"Slepian, D., Wolf, J., Noiseless coding of correlated information sources (1973) IEEE Trans.

In such cases, learning algorithms may have to cope with manipulated data aimed at hampering decision making. Although some previous work addressed the issue of handling malicious data in the context of supervised learning, very little is known about the behavior of anomaly detection methods in such scenarios. In this contribution,1 we analyze the performance of a particular method-online centroid anomaly detection-in the presence of adversarial noise. Our analysis addresses the following security-related issues: formalization of learning and attack processes, derivation of an optimal attack, and analysis of attack efficiency and limitations. We derive bounds on the effectiveness of a poisoning attack against centroid anomaly detection under different conditions: attacker's full or limited control over the traffic and bounded false positive rate. Our bounds show that whereas a poisoning attack can be effectively staged in the unconstrained case, it can be made arbitrarily difficult (a strict upper bound on the attacker's gain) if external constraints are properly used. Our experimental evaluation, carried out on real traces of HTTP and exploit traffic, confirms the tightness of our theoretical bounds and the practicality of our protection mechanisms. © 2012 Marius Kloft and Pavel Laskov.","Adversarial; Anomaly detection; Computer security; Network intrusion detection; Security analysis; Support vector data description","Adversarial; Anomaly detection; Network intrusion detection; Security analysis; Support vector data description; Data description; Data handling; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Security of data; Security systems",,,,,"Angluin, D., Laird, P., Learning from noisy examples (1988) Machine Learning, 2 (4), pp. 434-470; Auer, P., Learning nested differences in the presence of malicious noise (1997) Theoretical Computer Science, 185 (1), pp. 159-175. , PII S0304397597000194; Bailey, M., Oberheide, J., Andersen, J., Mao, Z.M., Jahanian, F., Nazario, J., Automated classification and analysis of internet malware (2007) Recent Adances in Intrusion Detection (RAID), pages 178-197; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Joseph, A., Tygar, J., Can machine learning be secure (2006) ACM Symposium on Information, Computer and Communication Security, pp. 16-25; Barreno, M., Bartlett, P.L., Chi, F.J., Joseph, A.D., Nelson, B., Rubinstein, B.I., Saini, U., Tygar, J.D., Open problems in the security of learning (2008) AISec '08: Proceedings of the 1st ACM workshop on Workshop on AISec, pp. 19-26. , New York, NY, USA, ACM; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., The security of machine learning (2010) Machine Learning, 81 (2), pp. 121-148; Boser Bernhard, E., Guyon Isabelle, M., Vapnik Vladimir, N., Training algorithm for optimal margin classifiers (1992) Proceedings of the Fifth Annual ACM Workshop on Computational Learning Theory, pp. 144-152; Braun, M.L., Buhmann, J., M̌uller, K.-R., On relevant dimensions in kernel feature spaces (2008) Journal Of Machine Learning Research, 9, pp. 1875-1908. , Aug; Bschouty, N.H., Eiron, N., Kushilevitz, E., Pac learning with nasty noise (1999) Algorithmic Learning Theory (ALT 1999), pp. 206-218; Cretu, G., Stavrou, A., Locasto, M., Stolfo, S., Keromytis, A., Casting out demons: Sanitizing training data for anomaly sensors (2008) Proc. of IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 81-95; Cretu-Ciocarlie, G.F., Stavrou, A., Locasto, M.E., Stolfo, S.J., Adaptive anomaly detection via self-calibration and dynamic updating (2009) Recent Adances in Intrusion Detection (RAID), pp. 41-60; Dalvi, N., Domingos, P., Sumit, M., Verma, S.D., (2004) Adversarial Classification KDD, pp. 99-108. , ACM Press; Dekel, O., Shamir, O., Learning to classify with missing and corrupted features (2008) International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pp. 216-223; Dekel, O., Shamir, O., Xiao, L., Learning to classify with missing and corrupted features (2009) Machine Learning; Fogla, P., Lee, W., Evading network anomaly detection systems: Formal reasoning and practical techniques (2006) Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 59-68. , DOI 10.1145/1180405.1180414, 1180414, CCS 2006: Proceedings of the 13th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security; Fogla, P., Sharif, M., Perdisci, R., Kolesnikov, O., Lee, W., Polymorphic blending attacks (2006) Proc. of USENIX Security Symposium, pp. 241-256; Forrest, S., Hofmeyr, S., Somayaji, A., Longstaff, T., A sense of self for unix processes (1996) Proc. of IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 120-128. , Oakland, CA, USA; Globerson, A., Roweis, S., Nightmare at test time: Robust learning by feature deletion (2006) International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pp. 353-360; Hofmeyr, S., Forrest, S., Somayaji, A., Intrusion detection using sequences of system calls (1998) Journal of Computer Security, 6 (3), pp. 151-180; Kearns Michael, Li Ming, Learning in the presence of malicious errors (1993) SIAM Journal on Computing, 22 (4), pp. 807-837; Laskov, P., Kloft, M., A framework for quantitative security analysis of machine learning (2009) AISec ACM, pp. 1-4. , D.

Toward thatend a project is underway to catalog re-usable patterns of self-organizing security of many kinds, principally found in natural systems, butalso seen in recent computational approaches. One class of pattern of special interest involves discovery of previously unseen threats and attacks. In general this class of pattern has aspects of learning, innovation, and evolution as capability objectives. The genetic algorithm is one such pattern. Another such pattern is seen in artificial neural networks. Combining the two into a Genetic Algorithm augmented Neural Network, often called GANN, has considerable recenthistory in the literature. Not many of these are directly related to security applications. Some security-application work shows GANNs employed for feature selection provide enhanced learning performance and accuracy, and avoidance of local minimum traps.

A project is underway that has identified six so-called SAREPH characteristics of adversarial self-organizing agility, and is now cataloging patterns toward a pattern language of self-organizing security techniques thatcan be employed for equal or superior security agility. IVanysuch patterns have recently been developed. This paperadds the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to the catalog. The essence of a GA is to express the problem to be optimized in terms of a 'fitness function' that evaluates howwell candidates optimize the solution. In natural evolution fitness is an organism's ability to survive and reproduce.

In this paper, we present a framework for robust detection of malicious documents through machine learning. Our approach is based on features extracted from document metadata and structure. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate the the adequacy of these document properties for malware detection and the durability of these features across new malware variants. Our analysis shows that the Random Forests classification method, an ensemble classifier that randomly selects features for each individual classification tree, yields the best detection rates, even on previously unseen malware. Indeed, using multiple datasets containing an aggregate of over 5,000 unique malicious documents and over 100,000 benign ones, our classification rates remain well above 99% while maintaining low false positives of 0.2% or less for different classification parameters and experimental scenarios. Moreover, the classifier has the ability to detect documents crafted for targeted attacks and separate them from broadly distributed malicious PDF documents. Remarkably, we also discovered that by artificially reducing the influence of the top features in the classifier, we can still achieve a high rate of detection in an adversarial setting where the attacker is aware of both the top features utilized in the classifier and our normality model. Thus, the classifier is resilient against mimicry attacks even with knowledge of the document features, classification method, and training set.

These attacks can result in full system compromise, but often the attacker gains control only over some system components (e.g., a peripheral) and over some applications running on the system. We consider the latter scenario and focus on enabling onschedule execution of critical applications that are running on a partially compromised system - we call this trusted scheduling. We identify the essential properties needed for the realization of a trusted scheduling system and we design an embedded system that achieves these properties. We show that our system protects not only against misbehaving applications but also against attacks by compromised peripherals. We evaluate the feasibility and performance of our system through a prototype implementation based on the AVR ATmega103 microcontroller.

While it is possible that an adversary obtains a subset of the symmetric keys in use, it has been unclear how to use those to compromise specific secure links. We investigate how the adversary could do this practically. We term this the Stealthy Pre-Attack (SPA), because the adversarial nodes leverage benign behavior to guide their attack. The contribution of this paper is the identification of this adversarial behavior, the evaluation of its benefits for the attacker, which can then much more effectively compromise security, and the proposal of counter-measures to mitigate it. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Key pre-distribution; Node compromise; Symmetric keys; Sensor nodes; Network security",,,,,"Eschenauer, L., Gligor, V.D., A key-management scheme for distributed sensor networks (2002) Proc. of the 9th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 41-47. , Washington, DC, USA, November 18-22; Chan, H., Perrig, A., Song, D., Random key predistribution schemes for sensor networks (2003) Proc. of IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 197-213. , Berkeley, California, May 11-14; Du, W., Deng, J., Han, Y.S., Varshney, P.K., A pairwise key pre-distribution scheme for wireless sensor networks (2003) Proc. of the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS '03, pp. 42-51. , Washington, DC, USA, October 27-31; Liu, D., Ning, P., Establishing pairwise keys in distributed sensor networks (2003) Proc. of the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS '03, pp. 52-61. , Washington, DC, USA, October 27-31; Akyildiz, I.F., Su, W., Sankarasubramaniam, Y., Cayirci, E., A survey on sensor networks (2002) IEEE Communications Magazine, pp. 102-114. , August; Chan, H., Perrig, A., Song, D., Random key predistribution schemes for sensor networks (2002) Technical Report 02-207, Carnegie Mellon University; Moore, T., A collusion attack on pairwise key predistribution schemes for distributed sensor networks (2006) Proc. of the 3rd Annual IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops, , Pisa, Italy, March; Kausar, F., A key distribution scheme preventing collusion attacks in ubiquitous heterogeneous sensor networks (2007) Emerging Directions in Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing, pp. 745-757. , M.

In SQL injection vulnerability, the database server is forced to execute malicious operations which may cause the data loss or corruption, denial of access, and unauthentic access to sensitive data by crafting specific inputs. Most of existing methods are based on encryption, syntax parse trees or semantic equivalence of the SQL statements. As no learning and adaption capabilities in these methods, they are not suitable for adversarial environments. A new method named k-centers (KC) is proposed to detect SQL injection attacks (SQLIAs) in this paper. The number and the centers of the clusters in KC are adjusted according to unseen SQL statements in the adversarial environment, in which the types of attacks are changed after a period of time, to adapt different kinds of attacks.

According to the profiles of user or items, a collaborative filtering recommender system recommends items to targeted customers according to the preferences of their similar customers. It provides customer useful relevant information. Unfortunately, the recommender system is vulnerable to profile injection attacks. In the profile inject attack, the similar user profiles are manipulated by injecting a large number of fake profiles into the system. In this paper, four new attributes for the injection attack detection are proposed. We also discuss the profile injection attacks in adversarial learning environment. By applying the Localized Generalization Error Model (L-GEM), a more robustness attack profile detection system is proposed. Experimental results show that L-GEM based detection classifier has better robustness. © 2012 IEEE.","adversarial leaning; Collaborative filtering recommender; Localized Generalization Error Model (L-GEM); profile injection attack; robustness","Adversarial environments; adversarial leaning; Adversarial learning; Attack detection; Collaborative filtering; Detection system; E-commerce systems; Localized generalization error models; profile injection attack; User profile; Cybernetics; Electronic commerce; Learning systems; Robustness (control systems); Sales; Recommender systems",,,,,"Lam, S.K., Riedl, J., Shilling Recommender Systems for Fun and Profit (2004) Proceeding of the 13th International Conference on World Wide Web, New York, pp. 393-402; Chirita, P.A., Nejdl, W., Zamfir, C., Preventing Shilling Attacks in On-line Recommender System (2005) Proceeding of the 7th Annual ACM International Workshop on Web Information and Data Management, pp. 67-74; Burke, R., Mobasher, B., Williams, C., Detecting Profile Attacking in Collaborative Recommender System (2006) Proceedings of the 8th IEEE International Conference on E-Commerce Technology and the 3rd IEEE International Conference on Enterprise Computing, pp. 23-30; Bhaumik, R., Williams, C., Mobasher, B., Securing Collaborative Filtering Against Malicious Attacks Through Anomaly Detection (2006) Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Intelligent Techniques for Web Personalization, Boston, pp. 50-59; Zhang, S., Chakrabarti, A., Ford, J., Attack Detection in Time Series for Recommender Systems (2006) Proceedings of the 12th ACM SiGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 809-814; Mehta, B., Unsupervised Shilling Detection for Collaborative Filtering (2007) Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, pp. 1402-1407; Williams, C.A., Mobasher, B., Burke, R., Detecting Profile Injection Attacks in Collaborative Filtering: A Classification-Based Approach (2007) Advances in Web Mining and Web Usage Analysis, pp. 167-186; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Can Machine Learning be Secure?

Nevertheless, active learning is vulnerable in adversarial environments, including intrusion detection or spam filtering. The purpose of this paper was to reveal how active learning can be attacked in such environments. In this paper, three contributions were made: first, we analyzed the sampling vulnerability of active learning; second, we presented a game framework of attack against active learning; third, two sampling attack methods were proposed, including the adding attack and the deleting attack. Experimental results showed that the two proposed sampling attacks degraded sampling efficiency of naive-bayes active learner. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Active Learning; Adversarial Environment","Active learners; Active Learning; Adversarial environments; Attack methods; Sampling efficiency; Spam filtering; Intrusion detection; Artificial intelligence",,,,,"Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., Can machine learning be secure?

Combined with non-intrusive load monitors, smartmeter data can reveal precise home appliance usage information. An emerging solution to behavior leakage in smart meter measurement data is the use of battery-based load hiding. In this approach, a battery is used to store and supply power to home devices at strategic times to hide appliance loads from smartmeters. A few such battery control algorithms have already been studied in the literature, but none have been evaluated from an adversarial point of view. In this paper, we first consider two well known battery privacy algorithms, Best Effort (BE) and Non-Intrusive Load Leveling (NILL), and demonstrate attacks that recover precise load change information, which can be used to recover appliance behavior information, under both algorithms. We then introduce a stepping approach to battery privacy algorithms that fundamentally differs from previous approaches by maximizing the error between the load demanded by a home and the external load seen by a smart meter. By design, precise load change recovery attacks are impossible. We also propose mutual-information based measurements to evaluate the privacy of different algorithms. We implement and evaluate four novel algorithms using the stepping approach, and show that under the mutual-information metrics they outperform BE and NILL.

To accommodate the dynamic nature of MANETs, this reservation-based approach has been made adaptive in a number of ways in response to the fluctuating availability of network bandwidth. This approach, however, requires the collaboration and co-operation of intermediate nodes, and assumes they are trustworthy and correctly execute routing and QoS operations. This paper uses a simulation study to demonstrate that this single-path adaptation approach to MANET QoS provisioning is no longer sufficient in adversarial environments, and identifies the conditions under which an additional measure, e.g., an adaptive multi-path routing extension, may be necessary to maintain service quality. The study uses the INSIGNIA signalling system as a facilitator of the single-path adaptation approach, and evaluates its effectiveness in the presence of blackhole and grayhole data forwarding attacks and a denial of QoS request attack on QoS signalling. Results are evaluated using the service quality metric defined in this paper. The results show that blackhole attacks, unlike the other two attacks, can prevent single-path adaptation, thus significantly inhibiting the service quality. Additionally, high network loads contribute to lower service quality. Whilst multi-path adaptation may be used as the routing extension, care must be taken to ensure that the network is not saturated as the result of additional packet transmissions. © 2012 IEEE.","Mobile ad hoc networks; quality of service; security","Adversarial environments; Bandwidth reservation; Black holes; Data-forwarding; Dynamic nature; Intermediate node; Multi path routing; Network bandwidth; Network load; Packet transmissions; QOS provisioning; security; Service Quality; Signalling systems; Simulation studies; Single path; Mobile ad hoc networks; Mobile computing; Wireless telecommunication systems; Quality of service",,,,,"Corson, S., MacKer, J., (1999) Mobile Ad Hoc Networking (MANET): Routing Protocol Performance Issues and Evaluation Considerations, , http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2501.txt, January, Internet Engineering Task Force; Corson, M.S., MacKer, J.P., Cirincione, G.H., Internet-based Mobile Ad hoc Networking (1999) Internet Computing, IEEE, 3 (4), pp. 63-70. , August; Marti, S., Giuli, T.J., Lai, K., Baker, M., Mitigating routing misbehavior in mobile ad hoc networks (2000) MobiCom '00: Proceedings of the 6th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking, pp. 255-265. , New York, NY, USA: ACM Press; McNerney, P.J.J., Zhang, N., Towards an integration of security and quality of service in ip-based mobile ad hoc networks (2011) Proceedings of the Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM 2011) 2011 IEEE, , December, Houston, Texas, USA; Yoo, Y., Agrawal, D.P., Why does it pay to be selfish in a MANET?

There are two challenges for automated mission planning. First, the environment and mission target maybe encounter dynamic change. Second, the several objectives are often conflicting and adjustable in different mission stages. Aim to conquer the difficulties, an intelligent and multi-objective receding horizon control framework is proposed. The framework integrates multi-objective optimization, receding horizon control, fuzzy inference system and expert knowledge together, which can online receding and adaptively adjust the objectives according to the environment and the state of the mission execution. For UCAV mission planning in adversarial environments, once the multi-objective optimization problem is solved at each sampling time and the non-inferior solutions belonging to the set of Pareto are obtained, the most satisfied one is selected by using the objectives weights inferred from the expert decision. Results are shown on typical examples of UCAV mission planning under dynamic environments, which illustrated the feasibility and applicability of the proposed method. © 2012 IEEE.","expert decision; mission planning; multi-objective optimization; nonlinear optimization; receding horizon control; unmanned combat aerial vehicles","expert decision; Mission planning; Multi objective optimizations (MOO); Non-linear optimization; Receding horizon control; Unmanned combat aerial vehicles; Computer science; Data processing; Multiobjective optimization; Military vehicles",,,,,"Goerzen, C., Mettler, Z.K.B., A survey of motion planning algorithms from the perspective of autonomous UAV guidance (2010) Journal of Intelligence Robot System, 10, pp. 65-100; Lavalle, S.M., (2006) Planning Algorithms, , London: Cambridge University Press; Dadkhah, N., Mettler, B., Survey of motion planning literature in the presence of uncertainty: Considerations for UAV guidance (2012) Journal of Intelligent & Robotic Systems, 65, pp. 233-246. , Jan; Camacho, E.F., Bordons, C., (2004) Model Predictive Control, , (2nd ed.): Springer; Chao, Z., UAV formation flight based on nonlinear model predictive control (2012) Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 2012; Jansen, F., Agile unmanned vehicle navigation in highly confined environments (2011) 2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, pp. 2381-2386; Wang, Y., Study of multi-objective fuzzy optimization for path planning (2012) Chinese Journal of Aeronautics, pp. 51-56; Haagsma, A., Veggel, E.V., (2011) Helicopter Fuel Bum Modeling in AEDT, , John A.

There are quite a few approaches in the literature that use WSN to monitor pipelines (water, gas, oil, and various other types of pipelines). The primary goal of all these protocols is to detect device malfunctions such as pipe leakage, oil spillage etc. However, none of these protocols are specifically designed to handle a malicious active adversary such as terrorist attacks. In this paper, we present a game theoretic approach to monitoring pipeline infrastructures using WSNs in the adversarial context. More specifically, we use Stackelberg competition to model attacker-defender interaction and derive the equilibrium condition of such a game under appropriate utility functions. Finally, we show that a monitoring system can do no better by deviating from its equilibrium strategy if the adversary acts rationally. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Active adversary; Civil structure; Equilibrium conditions; Equilibrium strategy; Game-theoretic; Low-cost sensors; Monitoring system; Oil spillage; Pipeline infrastructure; Pipeline monitoring; Power grids; Stackelberg; Terrorist attacks; Utility functions; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Game theory; Information use; Pipelines; Sensor nodes",,,,,"At least 100 nigerians dead in pipe blast ABC News, , http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=83184; Nigerian pipeline blast kills up to 200 USA TODAY, , http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-05-12-nigeriax.htm; Cormen, T.H., Leiserson, C.E., Rivest, R.L., Stein, C., Maximum Flow (2002) Introduction to Algorithms, pp. 643-700. , chapter 26: The MIT Press; Ford, L.R., Fulkerson, D.R., Maximal flow through a network (1956) Canadian Journal of Mathematics, 8, pp. 399-404; Goldberg, A., Tarjan, R.E., A new approach to the maximum flow problem (1988) Journal of the ACM, 35, pp. 921-940; Jawhar, I., Mohamed, N., Shuaib, K., A framework for pipeline infrastructure monitoring using wireless sensor networks (2007) Wireless Telecommunications Symposium, pp. 1-7; Lim, H.-S., Ghinita, G., Bertino, E., Kantarcioglu, M., A game-theoretic approach for high-assurance of data trustworthiness in sensor networks (2012) ICDE; Liu, Y., Ning, P., Reiter, M.K., False data injection attacks against state estimation in electric power grids (2011) ACM Trans.

These operational psychologists seek to legitimize adversarial interventions against targets by prioritizing societal welfare over traditional, individual-focused principles of psychological ethics. In this essay, we distinguish adversarial operational psychology, which facilitates deceptive and coercive operations, from collaborative operational psychology, which optimizes personnel performance in high-risk operations. Our analysis finds that adversarial operational psychology is largely unsupported by the American Psychological Association Ethics Code, that its potential benefits are exceeded by the likelihood of irreversible harms, and that its military necessity is undemonstrated. We offer a three-factor framework for distinguishing between adversarial and collaborative operational psychology, and we recommend institutional separation of these roles so that professional psychologists do not serve in adversarial capacities. © 2012 American Psychological Association.","APA Ethics Code; Counterterrorism; Operational psychology; Psychological ethics; Psychological torture","ethics; psychology; terrorism; welfare provision; United States",,,,,"(1995), Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments.

Existing stylometry research assumes that authors have not attempted to disguise their linguistic writing style. We challenge this basic assumption of existing stylometry methodologies and present a new area of research: adversarial stylometry. Adversaries have a devastating effect on the robustness of existing classification methods. Our work presents a framework for creating adversarial passages including obfuscation, where a subject attempts to hide her identity, and imitation, where a subject attempts to frame another subject by imitating his writing style, and translation where original passages are obfuscated with machine translation services. This research demonstrates that manual circumvention methods work very well while automated translation methods are not effective. The obfuscation method reduces the techniques' effectiveness to the level of random guessing and the imitation attempts succeed up to 67% of the time depending on the stylometry technique used. These results are more significant given the fact that experimental subjects were unfamiliar with stylometry, were not professional writers, and spent little time on the attacks. This article also contributes to the field by using human subjects to empirically validate the claim of high accuracy for four current techniques (without adversaries).We have also compiled and released two corpora of adversarial stylometry texts to promote research in this field with a total of 57 unique authors. We argue that this field is important to a multidisciplinary approach to privacy, security, and anonymity. © 2012 ACM.","Algorithms; Experimentation Additional","Automated translation; Classification methods; Criminal investigation; Devastating effects; Experimentation Additional; Human subjects; Machine translations; Multi-disciplinary approach; Stylometry; Writing style; Algorithms; Linguistics; Research",,,,,"Abbasi, A., Chen, H., Writeprints: A stylometric approach to identity-level identification and similarity detection in cyberspace (2008) ACM Trans.

Adversarial attackers can identify the user and find sensitive locations where the user often visits. Although l-diversity can be applied to location data and protect the user's privacy by preserving variations of locations, it does not consider the difference of the adversary's knowledge and does not properly address each sensitive location. The sensitive locations vary depending on the adversary's knowledge which reflects the relationship between the adversary and the user. In this paper, we introduce multi-dimensional l-diversity (MDlD), an enhancement of location l-diversity, to control the privacy risk from published locations by considering the specific knowledge that an adversary has on the user. We also propose an anonymization algorithm that adopts both generalization and suppression of locations to satisfy the MDlD. To reduce information loss and to preserve the number of locations for each user as much as possible, our algorithm applies generalization preferentially to suppression. We also show the practicality of our algorithm based on experimental results which used two real world datasets. The results show the fact that MDlD enables the publication of precise enough location information while still preserving user's privacy. © 2012 IEEE.","Anonymity; Diversity; Location-Based Services; Privacy Preserving Data Publishing","Anonymity; Anonymization; Data publishing; Diversity; Information loss; Location data; Location information; Privacy risks; Real-world datasets; Specific knowledge; Internet; Location based services; Publishing; Algorithms",,,,,"Samarati, P., Sweeney, L., Generalizing data to provide anonymity when disclosing information (1998) Proc. of the 17th ACM-SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART Symposium on the Principles of Database Systems; Sweeney, L., K-anonymity: A model for protecting privacy (2002) International Journal on Uncertainty, Fuzzmess and Knowledgebased Systems, 10 (5); Bettmi, C., Wang, X., Jajodia, S., Protecting privacy against location-based personal identification (2005) 2nd VLDB Workshop SDM, pp. 185-199; Yarovoy, R., Bonchi, F., Lakshmanan, L., Wang, W., Anonymizmg moving objects: How to hide a MOB in a crotd?

This paper leverages the coevolutionary relationship between attackers and defenders to derive two new approaches to predictive defense, in which future attack techniques are anticipated and these insights are incorporated into defense designs. The first method combines game theory with machine learning to model and predict future adversary actions in the learner's ""feature space""; these predictions form the basis for synthesizing robust defenses. The second approach to predictive defense involves extrapolating the evolution of defense configurations forward in time, in the space of defense parameterizations, as a way of generating defenses which work well against evolving threats. Case studies with a large cyber security dataset assembled for this investigation demonstrate that each method provides effective, scalable defense against current and future attacks, outperforming gold-standard techniques. Additionally, preliminary tests indicate that a simple variant of the proposed design methodology yields defenses which are difficult for adversaries to reverse-engineer. © 2012 IEEE.","adversarial coevolution; cyber security; game theory; machine learning; predictive analytics; security informatics","Adaptive adversary; Border security; Co-evolution; Co-evolutionary; Counter terrorism; Cyber defense; Cyber security; Data sets; Design Methodology; Feature space; Fraud prevention; Parameterizations; Predictive analytics; Security informatics; Game theory; Information science; Learning systems; Security of data",,,,,"Proc. 2010 IEEE ISI, Vancouver, BC Canada, May 2010; Proc. 2011 IEEE ISI, Beijing, China, July 2011; Laskov, P., Lippmann, R., Machine learning in adversarial environments (2010) Machine Learning, 81 (SPEC.

Besides its intrinsic interest, this problem is also motivating by a completeness result of Barrington, stating that such protocols can be applied for general secure computation of arbitrary functions. For flexibility, we are interested in protocols which only require black-box access to the group G (i.e. the only computations performed by players in the protocol are a group operation, a group inverse, or sampling a uniformly random group element). Our investigations focus on the passive adversarial model, where up to t of the n participating parties are corrupted. Our results are as follows. We initiate a novel approach for the construction of black-box protocols for G-circuits based on k-of-k threshold secret-sharing schemes, which are efficiently implementable over any black-box (non-Abelian) group G. We reduce the problem of constructing such protocols to a combinatorial coloring problem in planar graphs. We then give three constructions for such colorings. Our first approach leads to a protocol with optimal resilience t &lt; n/2, but it requires exponential communication complexity O((t/2t+1)2 ·Ng) group elements and round complexity O((t/2t+1)2 ·Ng), for a G-circuit of size Ng. Nonetheless, using this coloring recursively, we obtain another protocol to t-privately compute G-circuits with communication complexity Poly(n)-Ng for any t ∈ O(n1-∈) where ∈ is any positive constant. For our third protocol, there is a probability δ (which can be made arbitrarily small) for the coloring to be flawed in term of security, in contrast to the first two techniques, where the colorings are always secure (we call this protocol probabilistic, and those earlier protocols deterministic). This third protocol achieves optimal resilience t &lt; n/2. It has communication complexity O(n5.056 (n +logδ-1) 2 · Ng) and the number of rounds is O(n 2.528· (n +logδ-1) · Ng). © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2011.","Black-box operations; Graph coloring; Multiparty computation; Non-Abelian group; Percolation theory; Planar graph; Word problem","Black boxes; Graph colorings; Multiparty computation; Non-abelian groups; Percolation theory; Planar graph; Word problem; Coloring; Communication; Cryptography; Graph theory; Graphic methods; Optimization; Electric network analysis",,,,,"Alon, N., Spencer, J.H., (2000) The Probabilistic Method, , Wiley-Interscience, New York; Bar-Ilan, J., Beaver, D., Non-cryptographic fault-tolerant computing in a constant number of rounds of interaction (1989) 8th Annual ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing, pp. 201-209. , ACM, New York; Barrington, D.A., Bounded-width polynomial-size branching programs recognize exactly those languages in NC1 (1986) 18th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, pp. 1-5. , ACM, New York; Ben-Or, M., Goldwasser, S., Wigderson, A., Completeness theorems for non-cryptographic fault-tolerant distributed computation (1988) 20th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, pp. 1-10. , ACM, New York; Benaloh, J., Secret sharing homomorphisms: Keeping shares of a secret (1987) Advances in Cryptology: Crypto'86, 263, pp. 251-260. , Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer, Berlin; Bollobàs, B., Riordan, O., (2006) Percolation, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Chaum, D., Crépeau, C., Damgård, I., Multi-party unconditionally secure protocols (1988) 20th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, pp. 11-19. , ACM, New York; Cramer, R., Fehr, S., Ishai, Y., Kushilevitz, E., Efficient multi-party computation over rings (2003) Advances in Cryptology: Eurocrypt'03, 2656, pp. 596-613. , Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer, Berlin; Damgård, I., Nielsen, J.B., Scalable and unconditionally secure multiparty computation (2007) Advances in Cryptology-Crypto'07, 4622, pp. 572-590. , Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer, Berlin; Damgård, I., Fitzi, M., Kiltz, E., Nielsen, J.B., Toft, T., Unconditionally secure constant-rounds multiparty computation for equality, comparison, bits and commitments (2006) 3rd Theory of Cryptography Conference.

While this centralized-adversary modeling suffices for capturing basic security properties such as secrecy of local inputs and correctness of outputs against coordinated attacks, it turns out to be inadequate for capturing security properties that involve restricting the sharing of information between separate adversarial entities. Indeed, to capture collusion-freeness and game-theoretic solution concepts, Alwen et al. [Crypto, 2012] propose a new ideal-model based definitional framework that involves a de-centralized adversary. We propose an alternative framework to that of Alwen et al. We then observe that our framework allows capturing not only collusion-freeness and game-theoretic solution concepts, but also several other properties that involve the restriction of information flow among adversarial entities. These include some natural flavors of anonymity, deniability, timing separation, and information-confinement. We also demonstrate the inability of existing formalisms to capture these properties. We then prove strong composition properties for the proposed framework, and use these properties to demonstrate the security, within the new framework, of two very different protocols for securely evaluating any function of the parties' inputs. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,"Alternative framework; Coordinated attack; Different protocols; Game-theoretic; Information flows; Multi-party protocols; Security properties; Solution concepts; Universally Composable Security; Cryptography; Game theory",,,,,"Alwen, J., Katz, J., Lindell, Y., Persiano, G., Shelat, A., Visconti, I., Collusion-Free Multiparty Computation in the Mediated Model (2009) LNCS, 5677, pp. 524-540. , Halevi, S.

This is especially so because powerful adversaries could compromise and control a significant fraction of the network nodes. A plethora of schemes has been developed to secure wireless sensor networks and resilience to sophisticated attacks has been analyzed. However, the question of how the adversary could deploy her resources to maximally affect the attacked system has remained largely unaddressed. This is the problem this paper is concerned with: Given a number of compromised entities (nodes) and cryptographic keys, how can the adversary devise a close-to- optimal attack tactic? To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation of its kind: while the basic adversarial behavior is well-known, the problem of how the adversary can optimally deploy her resources to maximize the attack impact has not been considered for WSNs. We consider an abstract model of the mission-critical WSN and the adversary, and we find that the determination of an optimal attack is computationally hard, thus, we devise an efficient heuristic approach. An intelligent adversarial resource allocation indeed yields disproportional gains for the attacker. Our analysis is the first necessary step to comprehend how to best address vulnerabilities.

To increase the eficiency of channel usage, wireless systems often use a Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol to per- form channel coordination by having each node announce its usage intentions; other nodes avoid making conicting trans- missions minimizing interference both to the node that has announced its intentions and to a node that cooperates by avoiding transmissions during the reserved slot. Tradition- ally, in a multi-channel environment, such announcements are made on a common control channel. However, this con- trol channel is vulnerable to jamming because its location is pre-assigned and known to attackers. Furthermore, the an- nouncements themselves provide information useful for jam- ming. In this paper, we focus on a situation where multiple wireless transmitters share spectrum in the presence of intel- ligent and possibly insider jammers capable of dynamically and adaptively changing their jamming patterns. We develop a framework for efiectively countering MAC- aware jamming attacks and then propose SimpleMAC, a protocol resilient to these attacks. SimpleMAC consists of two schemes (the Simple Transmitter Strategy and the Sim- ple Signaling Scheme) that are easily analyzed using game theory, and show the optimal adversarial behavior under these protocols. We evaluate our schemes mathematically, through Monte Carlo simulations, and by implementation on the WARP software-defined radio platform. SimpleMAC provides very rapid improvement over the alternative of not using any MAC protocol, and eventually converges to opti- mal performance (over six-fold improvement in SINR, 50% gains in Shannon capacity in a realistic mobile scenario).

Also, the adversary holding such a device can eavesdrop on communication between A and B for the lifetime of the system. We develop a dynamic scheme where the devices are preloaded with permanent keys according to a predistribution scheme, but these keys are not used directly for setting up session keys. For this purpose devices use a pool of temporal keys, which periodically are selected at random by a system provider. The temporal keys are broadcast by the system provider in an encrypted form (e.g. using the GSM network or local broadcasting services). For the transmission, the temporal keys are encrypted with permanent keys, each temporal key occurring m times encrypted with m different permanent keys. (Parameter m is a small constant.) Encrypting the same temporal key with different permanent keys has the effect that with a high probability two devices share many more temporal keys than the permanent keys from the main pool of keys. Also, the shared temporal keys come not only from ciphertexts encrypted with shared permanent keys but predominantly from ciphertexts encrypted with the permanent keys that are not shared by the devices. After each re-distribution different pairs of permanent keys provide such shared temporal keys. This feature is the key property of our design. It makes it possible not only to protect communication against an adversary that has collected a large fraction of keys from the main pool of keys, but also enables using key predistribution for authentication in the presence of such an adversary. Finally, we present a scheme for renewing the permanent keys in a way that an adversary loses the knowledge of permanent keys except for the keys that it learns via the legitimate devices that he holds. The scheme is based on projective plane techniques. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Such attacks exploit various forms of unintended information leakage, which is inherent to almost all physical implementations. Inspired by recent side-channel attacks, especially the ""cold boot attacks"" of Halderman et al. [Proceedings of the 17th USENIX Security Symposium, San Jose, CA, 2008, pp. 45-60], Akavia, Goldwasser, and Vaikuntanathan [Proceedings of the 6th IACR Theory of Cryptography Conference, San Francisco, CA, 2009, pp. 474-495] formalized a realistic framework for modeling the security of encryption schemes against a wide class of side-channel attacks in which adversarially chosen functions of the secret key are leaked. In the setting of public-key encryption, they showed that Regev's lattice-based scheme [Proceedings of the 37th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, Baltimore, MD, 2005, pp. 84-93] is resilient to any leakage of L/polylog(L) bits, where L is the length of the secret key. In this paper we revisit the above-mentioned framework and our main results are as follows. (A) We present a generic construction of a public-key encryption scheme that is resilient to key leakage from any hash proof system. The construction does not rely on additional computational assumptions, and the resulting scheme is as efficient as the underlying hash proof system. Existing constructions of hash proof systems imply that our construction can be based on a variety of numbertheoretic assumptions, including the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption (and its progressively weaker d-linear variants), the quadratic residuosity assumption, and Paillier's composite residuosity assumption. (B) We construct a new hash proof system based on the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption (and its d-linear variants) and show that the resulting scheme is resilient to any leakage of L(1 - o(1)) bits. In addition, we prove that the recent scheme of Boneh et al. [Advances in Cryptology-CRYPTO'08, Santa Barbara, CA, 2008, pp. 108-125], constructed to be a ""circularsecure"" encryption scheme, fits our generic approach and is also resilient to any leakage of L(1-o(1)) bits. (C) We extend the framework of key leakage to the setting of chosen-ciphertext attacks. On the theoretical side, we prove that the Naor-Yung paradigm is applicable in this setting as well, and obtain as a corollary encryption schemes that are CCA2-secure with any leakage of L(1 - o(1)) bits. On the practical side, we prove that variants of the Cramer-Shoup cryptosystem (along the lines of our generic construction) are CCA1-secure with any leakage of L/4 bits, and CCA2-secure with any leakage of L/6 bits. © by SIAM.

This allows data owners to assess the risk of outsourcing data in the cloud, making RDC a valuable tool for data auditing. A robust RDC scheme incorporates mechanisms to mitigate arbitrary amounts of data corruption. In particular, protection against small corruptions (i.e., bytes or even bits) ensures that attacks that modify a few bits do not destroy an encrypted file or invalidate authentication information. Early RDC schemes have focused on static data, whereas later schemes such as DPDP support the full range of dynamic operations on the outsourced data, including insertions, modifications, and deletions. Robustness is required for both static and dynamic RDC schemes that rely on spot checking for efficiency. However, under an adversarial setting there is a fundamental tension between efficient dynamic updates and the encoding required to achieve robustness, because updating even a small portion of the file may require retrieving the entire file. We identify the challenges that need to be overcome when trying to add robustness to a DPDP scheme. We propose the first RDC schemes that provide robustness and, at the same time, support dynamic updates, while requiring small, constant, client storage. Our first construction is efficient in encoding, but has a high communication cost for updates.

For learning problems that deal with an active adversary, it is important to model the adversary's attack strategy and develop robust learning models to mitigate the attack. These are the two objectives of this paper. We consider two attack models: a free-range attack model that permits arbitrary data corruption and a restrained attack model that anticipates more realistic attacks that a reasonable adversary would devise under penalties. We then develop optimal SVM learning strategies against the two attack models. The learning algorithms minimize the hinge loss while assuming the adversary is modifying data to maximize the loss. Experiments are performed on both artificial and real data sets. We demonstrate that optimal solutions may be overly pessimistic when the actual attacks are much weaker than expected. More important, we demonstrate that it is possible to develop a much more resilient SVM learning model while making loose assumptions on the data corruption models. When derived under the restrained attack model, our optimal SVM learning strategy provides more robust overall performance under a wide range of attack parameters. © 2012 ACM.","adversarial learning; attack models; robust SVM","Active adversary; Adversarial learning; Attack model; Attack strategies; Credit card fraud detections; Data corruption; Learning models; Learning problem; Learning strategy; Learning tasks; Optimal solutions; Real data sets; Robust learning; robust SVM; Spam filtering; Crime; Data mining; Learning algorithms; Optimization; Support vector machines",,,,,"(2012) LIBSVM Data: Classification, Regression, and Multi-label; (2012) UCI Machine Learning Repository; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., Can machine learning be secure?

The performance of predicate encryption schemes based on hidden subgroup problems depends on the number of hidden subgroups and this number should be optimized. The scheme presented here satisfies the selective security model under a non-interactive assumption where the number of terms does not depend on the number of adversarial queries. It is therefore as secure as the symmetric predicate scheme proposed by Shen et al., which is based on four groups, under a simpler assumption. Using three hidden groups instead of four, it has a message space more than 33% wider and is more resistant to integer factoring attacks with moderate security parameters. The available techniques for converting encryption schemes using composite-order bilinear groups into schemes using prime-order groups are applicable to our scheme. Compared with the previous scheme using the conversion techniques, our prime-order group instantiation is asymptotically more than 33% faster and has ciphertexts and tokens that are asymptotically 25% smaller. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","public cloud infrastructure; subgroup decision problem; symmetric predicate encryption","Ciphertexts; Decision problems; Encryption schemes; Four-group; Hidden subgroup problem; Inner product; Message space; public cloud infrastructure; Security model; Security parameters; Symmetric keys; Artificial intelligence; Cryptography",,,,,"Bethencourt, J., Sahai, A., Waters, B., Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (2007) IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 321-334. , IEEE Computer Society; Blundo, C., Iovino, V., Persiano, G., Predicate Encryption with Partial Public Keys (2010) IACR Cryptology, 2010, p. 476. , ePrint Archive; Boneh, D., Boyen, X., Efficient Selective-ID Secure Identity-Based Encryption Without Random Oracles (2004) LNCS, 3027, pp. 223-238. , Cachin, C., Camenisch, J.L.

It is desirable for a customer to read reviews of products or stores before making the decision of what or from where to buy. Due to the pervasive spam reviews, customers can be misled to buy low-quality products, while decent stores can be defamed by malicious reviews. We observe that, in reality, a great portion (> 90% in the data we study) of the reviewers write only one review (singleton review). These reviews are so enormous in number that they can almost determine a store's rating and impression. However, existing methods did not examine this larger part of the reviews. Are most of these singleton reviews truthful ones? If not, how to detect spam reviews in singleton reviews? We call this problem singleton review spam detection. To address this problem, we observe that the normal reviewers' arrival pattern is stable and uncorrelated to their rating pattern temporally. In contrast, spam attacks are usually bursty and either positively or negatively correlated to the rating. Thus, we propose to detect such attacks via unusually correlated temporal patterns. We identify and construct multidimensional time series based on aggregate statistics, in order to depict and mine such correlations. In this way, the singleton review spam detection problem is mapped to a abnormally correlated pattern detection problem. We propose a hierarchical algorithm to robustly detect the time windows where such attacks are likely to have happened. The algorithm also pinpoints such windows in different time resolutions to facilitate faster human inspection. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective in detecting singleton review attacks. We discover that singleton review is a significant source of spam reviews and largely affects the ratings of online stores. © 2012 ACM.","adversarial data mining; review spam; time series","Arrival patterns; Hierarchical algorithm; Low-quality products; Multidimensional time; Online store; Pattern detection; Rating pattern; Spam detection; Temporal pattern; Temporal pattern discovery; Time resolution; Time windows; Algorithms; Data mining; Electronic commerce; Rating; Time series; Internet",,,,,"Mukherjee, A., Liu, B., Wang, J., Glance, N., Jindal, N., Detecting group review spam WWW '11; Mukherjee, A., Liu, B., Glance, N., Spotting fake reviewer groups in consumer reviews WWW '12; Vahdatpour, A., Sarrafzadeh, M., Unsupervised discovery of abnormal activity occurrences in multi-dimensional time series, with applications in wearable systems SDM'10; Chandra, E., John, W.E., Bcp: An R Package for Performing a Bayesian Analysis of Change Point Problems (2007) Journal of Statistical Software; Lim, E.-P., Nguyen, V.-A., Jindal, N., Liu, B., Lauw, H.W., Detecting product review spammers using rating behaviors CIKM '10; Wang, G., Xie, S., Liu, B., Yu, P.S., Identify online store review spammers via social review graph ICDM'11; Cheng, H., Tan, P., Potter, C., Klooster, S.A., Detection and characterization of anomalies in multivariate time series SDM'09; Jon, K., Bursty and hierarchical structure in streams KDD '02; Karlin, S., Taylor, H.M., (1975) A First Course in Stochastic Processes, , Academic Press, 2 edition; Jindal, N., Liu, B., Opinion spam and analysis WSDM '08; Jindal, N., Liu, B., Lim, E.-P., Finding unusual review patterns using unexpected rules CIKM '10; Ott, M., Choi, Y., Cardie, C., Hancock, J.T., Finding deceptive opinion spam by any stretch of the imagination HLT '11; Michail, V., Marios, H., Dimitrios, G., Eamonn, K., Indexing multi-dimensional time-series with support for multiple distance measures KDD '03; Michail, V., Christopher, M., Zografoula, V., Dimitrios, G., Identifying similarities, periodicities and bursts for online search queries SIGMOD '04; Wu, G., Greene, D., Cunningham, P., Merging multiple criteria to identify suspicious reviews RecSys '10; Li, X., Han, J., Mining approximate top-k subspace anomalies in multi-dimensional time-series data VLDB'07","Xie, S.; Department of Computer Science, , Chicago, IL, United States; email: sxie6@uic.edu",,"ACM Spec.

However, such approaches largely overlook the way on how attack tools and unwanted programs are developed and distributed. Recent studies in underground economy reveal that suspicious attackers heavily utilize online social networks to form special interest groups and distribute malicious code. Consequently, examining social dynamics, as a novel way to complement existing research efforts, is imperative to systematically identify attackers and tactically cope with net-centric threats. In this paper, we seek a way to understand and analyze social dynamics relevant to net-centric attacks and propose a suite of measures called SocialImpact for systematically discovering and mining adversarial evidence. We also demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of our approach by implementing a proof-of-concept prototype Cassandra with a case study on real-world data archived from the Internet. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,"Malicious codes; Net-centric; Online social networks; Proof of concept; Real world data; Research efforts; Social dynamics; Special interest groups; Systematic analysis; Computer crime; Dynamics; Security of data; Security systems; Research",,,,,"Anselmi, D., Kuo, J., Santhanam, N., Boscovich, R., Microsoft Security Intelligence Report, 9; Thomas, K., The Koobface botnet and the rise of social malware (2010) Proc. of the 5th IEEE International Conference on Malicious and Unwanted Software (MALWARE), pp. 1-8; Bächer, P., Holz, T., Kötter, M., Wicherski, G., (2005) Know Your Enemy: Tracking Botnets-Using Honeynets to Learn More about Bots; Chiang, K., Lloyd, L., A case study of the rustock rootkit and spam bot Proc. of Usenix Workshop on Hot Topics in Understanding Botnets (2007); Stone-Gross, B., Cova, M., Cavallaro, L., Gilbert, B., Szydlowski, M., Kemmerer, R., Kruegel, C., Vigna, G., Your botnet is my botnet: Analysis of a botnet takeover (2009) Proc. of Computer and Communications Security (CCS), , ACM; Mushtaq, A., Smashing the Mega-d/Ozdok Botnet in 24 Hours, , http://blog.fireeye.com/research/2009/11/smashing-the-ozdok.html; Athanasopoulos, E., Makridakis, A., Antonatos, S., Antoniades, D., Ioannidis, S., Anagnostakis, K.G., Markatos, E.P., Antisocial Networks: Turning a Social Network into a Botnet (2008) LNCS, 5222, pp. 146-160. , Wu, T.-C., Lei, C.-L., Rijmen, V., Lee, D.-T.

In practice, this should be enforced while allowing some basic functionality for intermediate delegated nodes such as searching through encrypted content. This can be achieved using a Public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) scheme, first proposed by Boneh et al., which enables to search publicly encrypted messages for keywords without revealing any information about the message. The issue of PEKS schemes being vulnerable to keyword guessing attacks (KGAs) was first shown by Byun et al., and two of the most recent PEKS schemes, i. e., due to Rhee et al. in (ASIACCS, pp 376-379, 2009; IEICE Electron Express 6(5):237-243, 2009) and (J Syst Softw 83(5):763-771, 2010), respectively, are designed with this security in mind. In this paper, we treat this KGA problem in detail and define new security models to capture KGAs against PEKS and designated PEKS schemes. These models are more security sufficient than the model considered by Rhee et al. (J Syst Softw 83(5):763-771, 2010); indeed the latter model does not afford sufficient adversarial capability in the sense that it is much weaker than the adversarial capability considered in the original IND-CKA model of Boneh et al. Our new models allow to capture KGAs on three recent designated PEKS schemes that cannot be captured in the weaker model of Rhee et al. © 2012 The Brazilian Computer Society.","Adversarial model; Delegation; Guessing attack; Modern internet; Public-key encryption with keyword search; Security","Delegation; Encrypted messages; Guessing attacks; Internet infrastructure; Keyword search; Keyword searching; Public-key encryption; Security; Security model; Internet; Public key cryptography; Search engines; Security of data",,,,,"Abdalla, M., Bellare, M., Catalano, D., Kiltz, E., Kohno, T., Lange, T., Malone-Lee, J., Shi, H., (2005) Searchable encryption revisited: Consistency properties, relation to anonymous ibe, and extensions, 3621, pp. 205-222. , In: Shoup V (ed) CRYPTO.

The tensions over the size and scope of state and federal control that characterize many areas of American policy are crucial in education.

This new approach, which we call resource-competitive analysis, is concerned with the worst-case ratio of the cost incurred by an algorithm to the cost incurred by any adversarial strategy. Here, the notion of cost corresponds to any network resource such as bandwidth, computational power, or an onboard energy supply. An adversary who attacks the system is assumed to control and coordinate a large number of Byzantine users that can exhibit arbitrary deviation from any prescribed protocol; in other words, the adversary may select any strategy, whether it be rational or not. In a homogeneous network where all devices, correct and Byzantine, are resource constrained, relative cost is an especially well-motivated metric. An adversary who successfully attacks the system will be penalized by incurring a significantly higher cost than that experienced by correct users. Consequently, the adversary is forced to either (i) cease her malicious behavior or (ii) rapidly deplete the resources of her Byzantine users in perpetrating her attack. For a multitude of well-known distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) scenarios, this type of guarantee can be extremely valuable. Indeed, the utility of this approach has already been demonstrated for settings involving wireless ad-hoc networks where devices are battery powered and, thus, energy-constrained. Ultimately, we believe that resource-competitive analysis constitutes a useful technique for mitigating Byzantine behavior and that this approach to designing attack-resistant algorithms will find application in many other areas of distributed computing.

In Stackelberg game models of these systems the attacker knows only the probability that each target is covered by the defender, but is oblivious to the detailed timing of the coverage schedule. In many real-world situations, however, the attacker can observe the current location of the defender and can exploit this knowledge to reason about the defender's future moves. We study Stackelberg security games in which the defender sequentially moves between targets, with moves constrained by an exogenously specified graph, while the attacker can observe the defender's current location and his (stochastic) policy concerning future moves. We offer five contributions: (1) We model this adversarial patrolling game (APG) as a stochastic game with special structure and present several alternative formulations that leverage the general nonlinear programming (NLP) approach for computing equilibria in zero-sum stochastic games. We show that our formulations yield significantly better solutions than previous approaches. (2) We extend the NLP formulation for APG allow for attacks that may take multiple time steps to unfold. (3) We provide an approximate MILP formulation that uses discrete defender move probabilities. (4) We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy of an NLP-based approach, and systematically study the impact of network topology on the results. (5) We extend our model to allow the defender to construct the graph constraining his moves, at some cost, and offer novel algorithms for this setting, finding that a MILP approximation is much more effective than the exact NLP in this setting.

We assume that, over a sequence of rounds, an adversary either inserts a node with arbitrary connections or deletes an arbitrary node from the network. The network responds to each such change by quick ""repairs,"" which consist of adding or deleting a small number of edges. These repairs essentially preserve closeness of nodes after adversarial deletions,without increasing node degrees by too much, in the following sense. At any point in the algorithm, nodes v and w whose distance would have been - in the graph formed by considering only the adversarial insertions (not the adversarial deletions), will be at distance at most - log n in the actual graph, where n is the total number of vertices seen so far. Similarly, at any point, a node v whose degreewould have been d in the graph with adversarial insertions only, will have degree at most 3d in the actual graph. Our distributed data structure, which we call the Forgiving Graph, has low latency and bandwidth requirements. The Forgiving Graph improves on the Forgiving Tree distributed data structure from Hayes et al. (2008) in the following ways: 1) it ensures low stretch over all pairs of nodes, while the Forgiving Tree only ensures low diameter increase; 2) it handles both node insertions and deletions, while the Forgiving Tree only handles deletions; 3) it requires only a very simple and minimal initialization phase, while the Forgiving Tree initially requires construction of a spanning tree of the network. © Springer-Verlag 2012.","Dynamic; Networks; Peer-to-peer; Responsive; Self-healing; Stretch; Trees","Peer to peer; Responsive; Self-healing; Stretch; Trees; Data structures; Distributed computer systems; Dynamics; Networks (circuits); Peer to peer networks; Trees (mathematics)",,,,,"Andersen, D., Balakrishnan, H., Kaashoek, F., Morris, R., Resilient overlay networks (2001) Operating Systems Review (ACM), 35 (5), pp. 131-145. , DOI 10.1145/502059.502048; Awerbuch Baruch, Patt-Shamir Boaz, Peleg David, Saks Michael, Adapting to asynchronous dynamic networks (1992) Conference Proceedings of the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, pp. 557-570; Boman, I., Saia, J., Abdallah, C.T., Schamiloglu, E., Brief announcement: Self-healing algorithms for reconfigurable networks (2006) Symposium On Stabilization Safety And Security Of Distributed Systems(SSS; Cormen, T.H., Leiserson, C.E., Rivest, R.L., Stein, C., (2001) Introduction to Algorithms, , 2 edn.

Constrained resources in mobile stations make it critical for nodes to be able to cooperate to enhance communication and computation capabilities. However, the wireless and dynamic nature of the links presents easy attack vectors for adversaries. The ability to securely discover and identify neighboring nodes (secure ND) is a fundamental building block for such networks. Even a relatively weak adversarial relay has the capability of distorting the network view and diverting significant amount of traffic. This can cause significant performance degradation. In this paper, we utilize the physical layer authentication scheme introduced by Yu, Baras and Sadler [1] to secure neighborhood discovery against adversarial relays. The proposed method incurs little performance overhead and requires no additional hardware. We provide analytical and simulation based performance evaluation of the security of our scheme. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Attack vector; Authentication scheme; Constrained resources; Dynamic nature; Fundamental building blocks; Mobile station; Neighboring nodes; Performance degradation; Performance evaluation; Physical layers; Wormhole attack; Authentication; Computer crime; Degradation; Network layers; Telecommunication networks; Ubiquitous computing; Wireless telecommunication systems; Mobile ad hoc networks",,,,,"Yu, P., Baras, J., Sadler, B., Physical-layer authentication (2008) IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 3 (1), pp. 38-51. , Mar; Khalil, I., Bagchi, S., Rotaru, C.N., Shroff, N.B., UnMask: Utilizing neighbor monitoring for attack mitigation in multihop wireless sensor networks (2010) Ad Hoc Networks, 8, pp. 148-164. , Mar; Shokri, R., Poturalski, M., Ravot, G., Papadimitratos, P., Hubaux, J.-P., A practical secure neighbor verification protocol for wireless sensor networks Proc. of the 2nd ACM Conference on Wireless Network Security, Mar. 2009, pp. 193-200; Hayajneh, T., Krishnamurthy, P., Tipper, D., SECUND: A protocol for secure neighborhood creation in wireless ad hoc networks Proc. of 2009 International Conference on Collaborative Computing, Nov. 2009, pp. 1-10; Hu, Y.-C., Perrig, A., Johnson, D., Packet leashes: A defense against wormhole attacks in wireless networks (2003) Proc. 2003 IEEE INFOCOM, 3, pp. 1976-1986; Tran, P.V., Hung, L.X., Lee, Y.-K., Lee, S., Lee, H., TTM: An efficient mechanism to detect wormhole attacks in wireless ad-hoc networks Proc. 2007 Consumer Communications and Networking Conference, Jan. 2007, pp. 593-598; Zheng, S., Jiang, T., Baras, J., Sonalker, A., Sterne, D., Gopaul, R., Hardy, R., Intrusion detection of in-band wormholes in MANETs using advanced statistical methods Proc. 2008 IEEE MILCOM, Nov. 2008, , DOI: 10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753177; Maheshwari, R., Gao, J., Das, S., Detecting wormhole attacks in wireless networks using connectivity information Proc 2007 IEEE INFOCOM, May 2007, pp. 107-115; Guler, I., Meghdadi, M., Ozdemir, S., A survey of wormhole-based attacks and their countermeasures in wireless sensor networks (2011) IETE Technical Review, 28 (2), pp. 89-102; Poturalski, M., Papadimitratos, P., Hubaux, J.-P., Secure neighbor discovery in wireless networks: Formal investigation of possibility Proc. of the ACM Symposium on Information, Computer and Communications Security, 2008, pp. 189-200; Nguyen, N.T., Zheng, G., Han, Z., Zheng, R., Device fingerprinting to enhance wireless security using nonparametric Bayesian method Proc. 2011 IEEE INFOCOM, April 2011, pp. 1404-1412; Candore, A., Kocabas, O., Koushanfar, F., Robust stable radiometric fingerprinting for wireless devices Proc.

Attacking a link has a certain cost for the attacker who also has the option of not attacking. We model the interaction between the network manager and the attacker as a bimatrix game and study the set of mixed strategy Nash equilibria. We define the notion of critical subset of links and determine the structure of a particular set of Nash equilibria when the attack cost is nonzero. In each NE of this set, the attacker targets edges in critical subsets and all edges in the same critical subset are attacked with the same probability. For the game of zero cost of attack considered in [8], we characterize the set of all Nash equilibria.

While there are a number of existing tools that can accurately identify known attacks, these are reactive (as opposed to proactive) in their enforcement, and may be eluded by previously unseen, adversarial behaviors. This paper proposes an approach that combines Structural Anomaly Detection (SA) from social and information networks and Psychological Profiling (PP) of individuals. SA uses technologies including graph analysis, dynamic tracking, and machine learning to detect structural anomalies in large-scale information network data, while PP constructs dynamic psychological profiles from behavioral patterns. Threats are finally identified through a fusion and ranking of outcomes from SA and PP. The proposed approach is illustrated by applying it to a large data set from a massively multi-player online game, World of War craft (WoW). The data set contains behavior traces from over 350,000 characters observed over a period of 6 months. SA is used to predict if and when characters quit their guild (a player association with similarities to a club or workgroup in non-gaming contexts), possibly causing damage to these social groups. PP serves to estimate the five-factor personality model for all characters. Both threads show good results on the gaming data set and thus validate the proposed approach. © 2012 IEEE.","Graph Learning; Insider Threat Detection; Psychological Context Modeling; Psychological Profiling; Structural Anomaly Detection; World of Warcraft","Context modeling; Graph Learning; Insider threat detections; Psychological Profiling; Structural anomaly; World of Warcraft; Information services; Behavioral research",,,,,"Salem, M., Stolfo, S., (2009) Masquerade Attack Detection Using a Search-behavior Modeling Approach, , Columbia University Computer Science Department, Technical Report # cucs-027-09; Thompson, P., Weak models for insider threat detection (2004) Proceedings of the SPIE, 5403. , Sensors and Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I) Technologies for Homeland Security and Homeland Defense III; Bradford, P., Hu, N., A layered approach to insider threat detection and proactive forensics ACSAC 2005; Raytheon Oakley Systems SureView, , http://www.raytheon.com/capabilities/products/cybersecurity/ insiderthreat/products/surview/, Retrieved Feb 14, 2012; Intelligent Desktop Surveillance, , http://www.lanxoma.com/, Retrieved Feb 14, 2012; http://www.packetmotion.com/, Retrieved Feb 14, 2012; (2009), http://www.cyber-ark.com/news-events/pr_20091123.asp, Press Release, November 23, Retrieved Feb 14, 2012; (2007) Computer Security Institute (CSI) Computer Crime and Security Survey, , http://i.cmpnet.com/v2.gocsi.com/pdf/CSISurvey2007.pdf, Retrieved Feb 14, 2012; (2008) Computer Security Institute (CSI) Computer Crime and Security Survey, , http://www.docstoc.com/docs/9484795/CSI-Computer-Crime-and-Security- Survey-2008, Retrieved Feb 14, 2012; Wasserman, S., Faust, K., (1994) Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications, , Cambridge, UK, Cambridge University Press; Burt, R., (1995) Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition, , Harvard University Press; Sparrow, M., The application of network analysis to criminal intelligence: An assessment of the prospects (1991) Social Networks, 13, pp. 251-274; Carley, K., Destabilizing terrorist networks (2003) 8th International Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium, National Defense War College, Washington DC; Burt, J.E., Mahoney, J.T., Personality correlates of structural holes (1998) Social Networks, 20, pp. 63-87; Carley, K., Dynamic network analysis (2003) NRC Workshop on Social Network Modeling and Analysis; Spitzner, L., Honeypots: Catching the insider threat ACSAC 2003; Bowen, B., Hershkop, S., Keromytis, A., Stolfo, S., Baiting inside attackers using decoy documents SecureComm 2009; Salem, M., Hershkop, S., Stolfo, S., A survey of insider attack detection research (2008) Insider Attack and Cyber Security: Beyond the Hacker, , Springer; Marbury, M., Chase, P., Cheikes, B., Brackney, D., Matzner, S., Hetherington, T., Wood, B., Lewandowski, S., Analysis and Detection of Malicious Insiders, , Technical Paper, Case #05-0207; Herbig, K., (2008) Changes in Espionage by Americans: 1947-2007, , Department of Defense Technical Report 08-05, March; Herbig, K., Wiskoff, M., Espionage against the United States by American citizens 1947-2001 (2002) PERSEREC Technical Report 02-5, , July; Band, S., Capppelli, D., Fischer, L., Mooore, A., Shaw, E., Trzeciak, R., Comparing Insider IT Sabotage and Espionage: A Model-Based Analysis, , Technical Report CMU/SEI-2006-TR-026; Keeney, M., Kowalski, E., Cappelli, D., Moore, A., Shimeall, T., Rogers, S., Insider Threat Study: Comuter System Sabotage in Critical Infrastructure Sectors, , U.

Decoy information and documents represent a promising approach to detecting malicious masqueraders, however, false positives can interfere with legitimate work and take up user time. We propose generating foreign language decoy documents that are sprinkled with untranslatable enticing proper nouns such as company names, hot topics, or apparent login information. Our goal is for this type of decoy to serve three main purposes. First, using a language that is not used in normal business practice gives real users a clear signal that the document is fake, so they waste less time examining it. Second, an attacker, if enticed, will need to exfiltrate the document's contents in order to translate it, providing a cleaner signal of malicious activity. Third, we consume significant adversarial resources as they must still read the document and decide if it contains valuable information, which is made more difficult as it will be somewhat scrambled through translation. In this paper, we expand upon the rationale behind using foreign language decoys.

In this situation, a fundamental problem is how to detect and quantify the amount of work performed by the adversary. To address this issue, we propose AnKLe (for Attack-tolerant enhanced Kullback-Leibler divergence Estimator), a novel algorithm for estimating the KL divergence of an observed stream compared to the expected one. AnKLe combines sampling techniques and information-theoretic methods. It is very efficient, both in terms of space and time complexities, and requires only a single pass over the data stream. Experimental results show that the estimation provided by AnKLe remains accurate even for different adversarial settings for which the quality of other methods dramatically decreases. © 2012 IEEE.","Byzantine Adversary; Data Stream; Kullback-Leibler Divergence; Performance Analysis; Sampling; Scalability","Byzantine Adversary; Data stream; Detecting attacks; Information divergence; Information-theoretic methods; KL-divergence; Kullback Leibler divergence; Large-scale distributed system; Novel algorithm; Performance analysis; Sampling technique; Single pass; Space and time complexity; Algorithms; Data communication systems; Information theory; Sampling; Scalability; Estimation",,,,,"Subhabrata, B.K., Krishnamurthy, E., Sen, S., Zhang, Y., Chen, Y., Sketch-based change detection: Methods, evaluation, and applications Internet Measurement Conference, 2003, pp. 234-247; Demaine, E.D., López-Ortiz, R., Munro, J.I., Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space (2002) Proceedings of the 10th Annual European Symposium on Algorithms, pp. 348-360. , Springer-Verlag; Bruck, J., Gao, J., Jiang, A.A., Localization and routing in sensor networks by local angle information (2009) ACM Transaction on Sensor Networks, 5, pp. 7:1-7:31. , http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1464420.1464427, February [Online].

It can be applied in a broad class of settings, including settings with asynchronous play and partial but incomplete revelation of early moves. Its computational and elicitation requirements are modest.

Benign system faults such as malfunctioning hardware, software glitches, and environmental hazards may impact overall system reliability but can often be mitigated by appropriate fault tolerance mechanisms. However, in an adversarial context, more subtle and difficult challenges to reliability can be faced and must be considered. This paper focuses the well-studied man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack problem where an attacker tampers with the characteristics of the network by mediating a link between legitimate nodes that does not have the properties required for correct network operation. This paper develops attack scenarios for unique network topologies, presents a timing and location-based analysis of MITM attack scenarios for each, and characterizes the limits of MITM detectability via timing analysis as a function of distance. © 2012 Authors.","chip-scale atomic clock; distributed sensor networks; man-in-the-middle attack; security; time synchronization; wireless sensor networks","Chip-scale atomic clocks; Distributed sensor networks; Man in the middle attacks; security; Time synchronization; Electric network topology; Machinery; Wireless sensor networks",,,,,"Chiang, J., Haas, J., Hu, Y., Kumar, P., Choi, J., Fundamental limits on secure clock synchronization and man-in-the-middle detection in fixed wireless networks Proceedings of INFOCOM.

The corresponding security proof has a reduction loss of O(ℓ·q), where ℓ is the bitlength of messages, and q is the number of adversarial signature queries. The original reduction could meanwhile be improved to O(√ℓ·q (Hofheinz and Kiltz, Crypto 2008); however, it is currently unknown whether a better reduction exists. We answer this question as follows: (a) We give a simple modification of Waters signatures, where messages are encoded such that each two encoded messages have a suitably large Hamming distance. Somewhat surprisingly, this simple modification suffices to prove security under the CDH assumption with a reduction loss of O(q). (b) We also show that any black-box security proof for a signature scheme with re-randomizable signatures must have a reduction loss of at least Ω(q), or the underlying hardness assumption is false. Since both Waters signatures and our variant from (a) are re-randomizable, this proves our reduction from (a) optimal up to a constant factor. Understanding and optimizing the security loss of a cryptosystem is important to derive concrete parameters, such as the size of the underlying group. We provide a complete picture for Waters-like signatures: there is an inherent lower bound for the security loss, and we show how to achieve it. © 2012 International Association for Cryptologic Research.","black-box reductions; Digital signatures; provable security; Waters signatures","Black boxes; Black-box reductions; Constant factors; Diffie-Hellman problem; Lower bounds; Optimal security; Provable security; Security proofs; Signature Scheme; Simple modifications; Authentication; Electronic document identification systems; Hamming distance; Optimization; Public key cryptography; Network security",,,,,"Attrapadung, N., Furukawa, J., Gomi, T., Hanaoka, G., Imai, H., Zhang, R., Efficient Identity-Based Encryption with Tight Security Reduction (2006) LNCS, 4301, pp. 19-36. , Pointcheval, D., Mu, Y., Chen, K.

Due to the pervasive spam reviews, customers can be misled to buy low-quality products, while decent stores can be defamed by malicious reviews. We observe that, in reality, a great portion (> 90% in the data we study) of the reviewers write only one review (singleton review). These reviews are so enormous in number that they can almost determine a store's rating and impression. However, existing methods ignore these reviewers. To address this problem, we observe that the normal reviewers' arrival pattern is stable and uncorrelated to their rating pattern temporally. In contrast, spam attacks are usually bursty and either positively or negatively correlated to the rating. Thus, we propose to detect such attacks via unusually correlated temporal patterns. We identify and construct multidimensional time series based on aggregate statistics, in order to depict and mine such correlation. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective in detecting singleton review attacks. We discover that singleton review is a significant source of spam reviews and largely affects the ratings of online stores.

It incorporates the opinions of all peers in the network to compute a global trust score for each peer based on its past behavior, and relies on a set of pre-trusted nodes to guarantee that malicious nodes cannot subvert the system. In this paper, we show that ET is vulnerable to community structure and a novel targeted attack based on eigenvector centrality, since ET ranks nodes close to the pre-trusted ones higher than those further away. To address these shortcomings, we propose Personalized EigenTrust (PET) which (i) enables each user to choose her trusted peers from the social network of peers, thereby eliminating the need of pre-trusted nodes and making the system autonomous, (ii) is effective in networks operating under various transaction models based on distributions such as random, community-like and power-law, and (iii) is robust to many types of attacks including the targeted one based on eigenvector centrality. Our simulation results reveal that PET outperforms ET under diverse transaction models and attack strategies. © 2012 IEEE.","community structure; eigenvector centrality attack; reputation system; social network","Attack strategies; Community structures; Eigenvector centralities; Malicious nodes; P2P system; Power-law; Reputation management; Reputation systems; Social Networks; Transaction model; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Social sciences; Peer to peer networks",,,,,"Barabási, A.L., Albert, R., Emergence of scaling in random networks (1999) Science, pp. 509-512; Bonacich, P., Lloyd, P., Eigenvector-like measures of centrality for asymmetric relations (2001) Social Networks; Chawathe, Y., Ratnasamy, S., Breslau, L., Lanham, N., Shenker, S., Making gnutella-like p2p systems scalable SIGCOMM'03; Chirita, P.A., Nejdl, W., Schlosser, M.T., Scurtu, O., Personalized reputation management in p2p networks ISWC '04; Choi, D., Jin, S., Lee, Y., Park, Y., Personalized eigentrust with the beta distribution ETRI '10; Danezis, G., Mittal, P., Sybilinfer: Detecting sybil nodes using social networks NDSS '09; Douceur, J.R., The sybil attack IPTPS '01; Fogarty, J., Baker, R.S., Hudson, S.E., Case studies in the use of roc curve analysis for sensor-based estimates in human computer interaction GI '05; Gyöngyi, Z., Garcia-Molina, H., Pedersen, J., Combating web spam with trustrank VLDB '04; Jansen, R., Kaminski, T., Korsakov, F., Croix, A.S., Selifonov, D., A priori trust vulnerabilities in eigentrust (2008) Technical Report University of Minnesota, , http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~jansen/papers/fet-csci5271.pdf; Jeh, G., Widom, J., Scaling personalized web search WWW '03; Kamvar, S.D., Schlosser, M.T., Garcia-Molina, H., The eigentrust algorithm for reputation management in p2p networks WWW '03; Leskovec, J., Lang, K.J., Dasgupta, A., Mahoney, M.W., Statistical properties of community structure in large social and information networks WWW '08; Lesniewski-Laas, C., Kaashoek, M.F., Whanau: A sybil-proof distributed hash table NSDI '10; Lian, Q., Zhang, Z., Yang, M., Zhao, B.Y., Dai, Y., Li, X., An empirical study of collusion behavior in maze p2p file-sharing system ICDCS '07; Mohaisen, A., Hopper, N., Kim, Y., Keep your friends close: Incorporating trust into social network-based sybil defenses IEEE INFOCOM '11; Quercia, D., Hailes, S., Sybil attacks against mobile users: Friends and foes to the rescue INFOCOM '10; Rahbar, A., Yang, O., Powertrust: A robust and scalable reputation system for trusted peer-to-peer computing (2007) IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems; Song, H.H., Cho, T.W., Dave, V., Zhang, Y., Qiu, L., Scalable proximity estimation and link prediction in online social networks IMC '09; Viswanath, B., Post, A., Gummadi, K.P., Mislove, A., An analysis of social network-based sybil defenses SIGCOMM '10; Yu, H., Gibbons, P.B., Kaminsky, M., Xiao, F., Sybillimit: A nearoptimal social network defense against sybil attacks IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy '08; Yu, H., Kaminsky, M., Gibbons, P.B., Flaxman, A., Sybilguard: Defending against sybil attacks via social networks SIGCOMM '06","Chiluka, N.; Delft University of TechnologyNetherlands; email: n.j.chiluka@tudelft.nl",,"IEEE Comput.

Concurrently, we have seen a proliferation of malicious attacks on large-scale distributed systems. Hence, there is a need for (i) consensus problems that take into consideration the presence of adversaries and specify correct behavior through appropriate conditions on agreement and safety, and (ii) algorithms for distributed control applications that solve such consensus problems resiliently despite breaches in security. This paper addresses these issues by (i) defining the adversarial asymptotic agreement problem, which requires that the uncompromised agents asymptotically align their states while satisfying an invariant condition in the presence of adversaries, and (ii) by designing a low complexity consensus protocol, the Adversarial Robust Consensus Protocol (ARC-P), which combines ideas from distributed computing and cooperative control. Two types of omniscient adversaries are considered: (i) Byzantine agents can convey different state trajectories to different neighbors in the network, and (ii) malicious agents must convey the same information to each neighbor. For each type of adversary, sufficient conditions are provided that ensure ARC-P guarantees the agreement and safety conditions in static and switching network topologies, whenever the number of adversaries in the network is bounded by a constant. The conservativeness of the conditions is examined, and the conditions are compared to results in the literature.

The unifying theme in this area is the need to develop methods for the analysis of allocation decisions when risks stem from the intentional actions of intelligent adversaries. Most approaches to these problems have a game-theoretic flavor although there are also several interesting decision-analytic-based proposals. One of them is the recently introduced framework for adversarial risk analysis, which deals with decision-making problems that involve intelligent opponents and uncertain outcomes. We explore how adversarial risk analysis addresses some standard counterterrorism models: simultaneous defend-attack models, sequential defend-attack-defend models, and sequential defend-attack models with private information. For each model, we first assess critically what would be a typical game-theoretic approach and then provide the corresponding solution proposed by the adversarial risk analysis framework, emphasizing how to coherently assess a predictive probability model of the adversary's actions, in a context in which we aim at supporting decisions of a defender versus an attacker. This illustrates the application of adversarial risk analysis to basic counterterrorism models that may be used as basic building blocks for more complex risk analysis of counterterrorism problems. © 2011 Society for Risk Analysis.","Adversarial risk analysis; Counterterrorism resource allocation; Defender-attacker models; Elicitation of attack probabilities; Intelligent adversary","Allocation decision; Basic building block; Corresponding solutions; Counter terrorism; Decision-making problem; Game-theoretic; Intelligent adversary; Private information; Probability models; Terrorist attacks; Terrorist threats; Game theory; Resource allocation; Terrorism; decision making; game theory; probability; resource allocation; risk assessment; terrorism; article; decision support system; game; risk assessment; terrorism; theoretical model; uncertainty; Decision Support Techniques; Game Theory; Models, Theoretical; Risk Assessment; Terrorism; Uncertainty",,,,,"English, R., (2009) Terrorism: How to Respond, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Lomborg, B., (2008) Solutions for the World's Biggest Problems, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Ezell, B.C., Bennett, S.P., von, W.D., Sokolowski, J., Collins, A.J., Probabilistic risk analysis and terrorism (2010) Risk Analysis, 30 (4), pp. 575-589; Gutfraind, A., (2009), Terrorism as a mathematical problem.

It uses 'authentic neighborhood' for route discovery process which potentially protects hidden channels of routing control packets, besides ensuring authenticity and integrity of routing control messages at hop-by-hop level. This authentic neighborhood is augmented by a process of traceability which uses promiscuous mode of a node to detect, diagnose and isolate the adversarial nodes, that disrupt the route discovery process. We observe, from the comparative analysis of the proposed protocol with Ariadne and EndiarA, that the proposed protocol has a balance between security and computational overhead. Security analysis and formal verification, through extended BAN logic and AVISPA toolkit, shows that the proposed protocol is safe against the vulnerabilities identified in Ariadne and EndairA, due to unprotected hidden channels.","Hidden channel attacks; Plausible route; Promiscuous mode; Secure route discovery; Tunnelling attack","Ariadne; BAN logic; Comparative analysis; Computational overheads; Formal verifications; Hidden channel attacks; Hop by hop; Plausible route; Promiscuous mode; Route discovery; Route discovery process; Routing control; Security analysis; Network security; Safety engineering; Routing protocols",,,,,"Elbayoumy, A., Shepherd, S., A high grade secure VoIP system using the tiny encryption algorithm (2005) Proceedings of 7th Annual International Symposium on Advanced Radio Technologies, , Boulder, Colorado, USA, 1-3 Mar; Satorras, R.P., Vespignani, A., An epidemic spreading in scale-free networks (2001) Physical Review Letters, 86 (14), pp. 3200-3203; Zou, C.C., Towsley, D., Gong, W., Email Virus Propagation Modeling and Analysis (2003) Technical Report, , TR-CSE-03-04, University of Massachusetts, Amherst; Perkins, C.E., Bhagwat, P., Highly Dynamic Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector Routing (DSDV) for Mobile Computers (1994) Proceedings of ACM SIGCOMM, pp. 234-244; Johnson, D., Maltz, D., Dynamic Source Routing in Ad Hoc Wireless Networks (1996) Mobile Computing, 353 (5), pp. 153-181. , Thomasz Imielinski and Hank Korth(Editors), Kluwer Academic Publishers; Papadimitratos, P., Haas, Z., Secure Routing for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (2002) Proceedings of SCS Communication Networks and Distributed Systems Modeling and Simulation Conference(CNDS '02), pp. 193-204; Perkins, C., Ad-Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing (1997) Proceedings of Military Comm.

Namely, all-but-many lossy trapdoor functions (ABM-LTFs) are LTFs that are parametrized with tags. Each tag can either be injective or lossy, which leads to an invertible or a lossy function. The interesting property of ABM-LTFs is that it is possible to generate an arbitrary number of lossy tags by means of a special trapdoor, while it is not feasible to produce lossy tags without this trapdoor. Our definition and construction can be seen as generalizations of all-but-one LTFs (due to Peikert and Waters) and all-but-N LTFs (due to Hemenway et al.). However, to achieve ABM-LTFs (and thus a number of lossy tags which is not bounded by any polynomial), we have to employ some new tricks. Concretely, we give two constructions that use ""disguised"" variants of the Waters, resp. Boneh-Boyen signature schemes to make the generation of lossy tags hard without trapdoor. In a nutshell, lossy tags simply correspond to valid signatures. At the same time, tags are disguised (i.e., suitably blinded) to keep lossy tags indistinguishable from injective tags. ABM-LTFs are useful in settings in which there are a polynomial number of adversarial challenges (e.g., challenge ciphertexts). Specifically, building on work by Hemenway et al., we show that ABM-LTFs can be used to achieve selective opening security against chosen-ciphertext attacks. One of our ABM-LTF constructions thus yields the first SO-CCA secure encryption scheme with compact ciphertexts ( group elements) whose efficiency does not depend on the number of challenges. Our second ABM-LTF construction yields an IND-CCA (and in fact SO-CCA) secure encryption scheme whose security reduction is independent of the number of challenges and decryption queries. © 2012 International Association for Cryptologic Research.","lossy trapdoor functions; public-key encryption; selective opening attacks","Arbitrary number; Boneh-Boyen signature scheme; Chosen ciphertext attack; Ciphertexts; Decryption query; Encryption schemes; IND-CCA; Polynomial number; Public-key encryption; Security reduction; selective opening attacks; Trapdoor functions; Public key cryptography; Network security",,,,,"Abe, M., Gennaro, R., Kurosawa, K., Tag-KEM/DEM: A new framework for hybrid encryption (2008) Journal of Cryptology, 21 (1), pp. 97-130; Applebaum, B., Ishai, Y., Kushilevitz, E., How to garble arithmetic circuits (2011) 52nd FOCS IEEE Computer Society Press; Ateniese, G., De Medeiros, B., Identity-based chameleon hash and applications (2004) LNCS, 3110, pp. 164-180. , Juels, A.

In practice, the adversary may strategically add good words indicative of a legitimate message or remove bad words indicative of spam. We assume that the adversary could afford to modify a spam message only to a certain extent, without damaging its utility for the spammer. Under this assumption, we present a large margin approach for classification of spam messages that may be disguised. The proposed classifier is formulated as a second-order cone programming optimization. We performed a group of experiments using the TREC 2006 Spam Corpus. Results showed that the performance of the standard support vector machine (SVM) degrades rapidly when more words are injected or removed by the adversary, while the proposed approach is more stable under the disguise attack. © 2012 Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Adversarial classification; Large margin; Second-order cone programming (SOCP); Spam filtering","Large margin; Legitimate messages; Second-order cone programming; Spam corpus; SPAM filter; Spam filtering; Spam mails; Spam messages; Support vector machines; Internet",,,,,"Carpinter, J., Hunt, R., Tightening the net: A review of current and next generation spam filtering tools (2006) Computers and Security, 25 (8), pp. 566-578. , DOI 10.1016/j.cose.2006.06.001, PII S0167404806000939; Chang, C., Lin, C., LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines (2011) ACM Trans.

Restrictions are partial assignments to input variables. Each restriction simplifies the device, and yields a new device for the restricted function on the unassigned variables. On one extreme, full restrictions (assigning all variables) correspond to evaluating the device on a complete input, yielding the result of the computation on that input, which is the same as standard black-box access. On the other extreme, empty restrictions (assigning no variables) yield a full description of the original device. We explore the grey-scale of possibilities in the middle. Focusing on learning theory, we show that restriction access provides a setting in which one can obtain positive results for problems that have resisted attack in the black-box access model. We introduce a PAC-learning version of restriction access, and show that one can efficiently learn both decision trees and DNF formulas in this model. These two classes are not known to be learnable in the PAC model with black-box access. Our DNF learning algorithm is obtained by a reduction to a general learning problem we call population recovery, in which random samples from an unknown distribution become available only after a random part of each is obliterated. Specifically, assume that every member of an unknown population is described by a vector of values. The algorithm has access to random samples, each of which is a random member of the population, whose values are given only on a random subset of the attributes. Analyzing our efficient algorithm to fully recover the unknown population calls for understanding another basic problem of independent interest: ""robust local inversion"" of matrices. The population recovery algorithm and construction of robust local inverses for some families of matrices are the main technical contributions of the paper. We also discuss other possible variants of restriction access, in which the values to restricted variables, as well as the subset of free (unassigned) variables, are generated deterministically or randomly, in friendly or adversarial fashions. We discuss how these models may naturally suit situations in computational learning, computational biology, automated proofs, cryptography and complexity theory. © 2012 ACM.",,"Access models; Automated proofs; Black boxes; Complexity theory; Computational biology; Computational devices; Computational learning; DNF formulas; Efficient algorithm; General learning; Input variables; Learning Theory; New devices; PAC learning; Random parts; Random sample; Random subsets; Recovery algorithms; Restricted functions; Technical contribution; Bioinformatics; Computer science; Decision trees; Forestry; FORTH (programming language); Innovation; Learning algorithms; Recovery; Computational complexity; Algorithms; Forestry; Innovation; Recovery",,,,,"Abramowitz, M., Stegun, I.A., Handbook of Mathematical Functions with Formulas, Graphs and Mathematical Tables (1964) Applied Mathematics Series, 55. , National Bureau of Standards, Washington, D.C., Reprinted by Dover, New York; Agrawal, D., Rao, J.R., Rohatgi, P., Multi-channel attacks (2003) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2779, pp. 2-16; Aho, A.V., Sagiv, Y., Szymanski, T.G., Ullman, J.D., Inferring a tree from lowest common ancestors with an application to the optimization of relational expressions (1981) SIAM J.

For example, the observations might include locations where a serial killer committed murders or where insurgents carried out Improvised Explosive Device (IED) attacks. In both these cases, we would like to infer a set of locations that explain the observations, for example, the set of locations where the serial killer lives/works, and the set of locations where insurgents locate weapons caches. However, unlike all past work on abduction, there is a strong adversarial component to this; an adversary actively attempts to prevent us from discovering such locations. We formalize such abduction problems as a two-player game where both players (an ""agent"" and an ""adversary"") use a probabilistic model of their opponent (i.e., a mixed strategy). There is asymmetry as the adversary can choose both the locations of the observations and the locations of the explanation, while the agent (i.e., us) tries to discover these. In this article, we study the problem from the point of view of both players. We define reward functions axiomatically to capture the similarity between two sets of explanations (one corresponding to the locations chosen by the adversary, one guessed by the agent). Many different reward functions can satisfy our axioms. We then formalize the Optimal Adversary Strategy (OAS) problem and the Maximal Counter-Adversary strategy (MCA) and show that both are NP-hard, that their associated counting complexity problems are #P-hard, and that MCA has no fully polynomial approximation scheme unless P=NP. We show that approximation guarantees are possible for MCA when the reward function satisfies two simple properties (zero-starting and monotonicity) which many natural reward functions satisfy. We develop a mixed integer linear programming algorithm to solve OAS and two algorithms to (approximately) compute MCA; the algorithms yield different approximation guarantees and one algorithm assumes a monotonic reward function. Our experiments use real data about IED attacks over a 21-month period in Baghdad. We are able to show that both the MCA algorithms work well in practice; while MCA-GREEDY-MONO is both highly accurate and slightly faster than MCA-LS, MCA-LS (to our surprise) always completely and correctly maximized the expected benefit to the agent while running in an acceptable time period. © 2012 ACM.","Abduction; Spatial reasoning","Abduction; Baghdad; Counting complexity; Geo-spatial; Improvised explosive devices; Mixed integer linear programming; Mixed strategy; Monotonicity; NP-hard; Probabilistic models; Reward function; Running-in; Spatial reasoning; Time-periods; Two-player games; Weapons caches; Data storage equipment; Polynomial approximation; Approximation algorithms",,,,,"Agmon, N., Kraus, S., Kaminka, G., Multi-robot perimeter patrol in adversarial settings (2008) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA'08), pp. 2339-2345; Agmon, N., Kraus, S., Kaminka, G., Sadov, V., Adversarial uncertainty in multi-robot patrol (2009) Proceedings of the 21st International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI'09), pp. 1811-1817; Charnes, A., Cooper, W., Programming with linear fractional functionals (1962) Naval Res.

In this paper, we model the interaction between the data miner and the adversary as Stackelberg games. Though existing algorithms for Stackelberg games efficiently find optimal solutions, they critically assume the follower plays optimally and rationally. Unfortunately, in real-world applications, because of follower's bounded rationality and limited observation of the leader's strategy, it may deviate from their expected optimal response. Considering this crucial problem, this paper solve for the Nash equilibrium. Experiments on real spam dataset demonstrate that bounded rationality and limited observation can make Stackelberg games more practical and provide interesting insights about the interaction between the data miner and the spammer in spam filtering. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Adversarial classification; Bounded rationality; Limited observation; Spam filtering; Stackelberg games","Bounded rationality; Data miners; Data sets; Filtering systems; Game models; Limited observation; Machine learning techniques; Malicious adversaries; Nash Equilibrium; Optimal response; Optimal solutions; Real-world application; Spam filtering; Stackelberg Games; Information technology; Materials science; Miners; Optimization; Internet",,,,,"Dalvi, N., Mausam Domingos, P., Sanghai, S., Verma, D., (2004) KDD'04, pp. 99-108. , New York: ACM; Lowd, D., Meek, C., (2005) KDD'05, pp. 641-647. , New York: ACM; M.

A large fraction of the available network capacity is consumed by a small percentage of Tor users, resulting in severe service degradation for the majority. Bulk users continuously drain relays of excess bandwidth, creating new network bottlenecks and exacerbating the effects of existing ones. While this problem may currently be attributed to rational users utilizing the network, it may also be exploited by a relatively low-resource adversary using similar techniques to contribute to a network denial of service (DoS) attack. Degraded service discourages the use of Tor, affecting both Tor’s client diversity and anonymity. Equipped with mechanisms from communication networks, we design and implement three Tor-specific algorithms that throttle bulk transfers to reduce network congestion and increase network responsiveness. Unlike existing techniques, our algorithms adapt to network dynamics using only information local to a relay. We experiment with full-network deployments of our algorithms under a range of light to heavy network loads. We find that throttling results in significant improvements to web client performance while mitigating the negative effects of bulk transfers. We also analyze how throttling affects anonymity and compare the security of our algorithms under adversarial attack. We find that throttling reduces information leakage compared to unthrottled Tor while improving anonymity against realistic adversaries. Copyright © 2019 21st USENIX Security Symposium.

WSNs have a wide range of applications where security is a primary concern. Among different security issues, the area of base station (BS) location privacy has been relatively less explored. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to protect the location privacy of the BS against external packet tracer attacks by employing asymmetric power control for the transmissions along the multi hop path between the source and the sink. The transmission range at each sensor node is varied with the objective of minimizing the amount of distance the packet tracer can travel towards the sink, thereby preventing the attacker from tracing packets directly to the BS. We formulate this as an optimization problem and derive the optimal transmission levels for the routing paths to the BS based on our utility that minimizes the mobility of the local adversary. We evaluate the level of security provided by our scheme and measure the overhead involved in terms of additional energy consumed in the network. © 2018 IEEE Computer Society.

Existing countermeasures against reactive jamming attacks, i.e. frequency hopping or channel surfing, requires excessive computational capabilities, which are infeasible for low cost resource constraint Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). To overcome the problems for normal lower power sensors, we propose an efficient localized jamming-resistant approach against reactive jamming attacks by identifying trigger nodes whose transmissions invoke the jammer. By constraining the trigger nodes to be receivers only, we can avoid invoking the jammers and completely nullify the reactive jamming attack. The triggers identification approach utilizes a hexagon tiling coloring and sequential Group Testing (GT), which does not demand any sophisticated hardware. Theoretical analyses and simulation results endorse the suitability of our localized algorithm in terms of time and message complexity. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.",,"Security of data; Sensor nodes; Computational capability; Identification approach; Interfering signals; Localized algorithm; Localized solutions; Resource Constraint; Transmission medium; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Jamming",,,,,"Bellardo, J., Savage, S.: 802.11 Denail-of-Service Sttacks: Real Vulnerabilities and Practical Solutions (2003) Proceedings of the 12Th Conference on USENIX Security Symposium; Sidek, O., Yahya, A., Reed Solomon Coding for Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum in Jamming Environment (2008) American Journal of Applied Sciences; Chiang, T., Hu, Y., Dynamic Jamming Mitigation for Wireless Broadcast Networks (2008) INFOCOM; Desmedt, Y., Safavi-Naini, R., Wang, H., Charnes, C., Pieprzyk, J., Broadcast Anti-Jamming Systems (1999) Computer Networks, pp. 349-355; Ling, Q., Ren, J., Li, T., Message-Driven Frequency Hopping — Design and Analysis (2008) WASA 2008.

In order to improve traffic safety and ensure the event messages reliability, more and more researches have been focused on trust management to resolve the problems. However, in these researches, little attention has been paid to the location privacy due to the natural conflict between trust and anonymity, which is the basic protection of privacy. Although traffic safety remains the most crucial requirement in VANETs, location privacy can be just as important for drivers, and neither can be ignored. In this paper, we propose a self-organized trust management system that aims to thwart internal attackers from sending false messages in privacy-enhanced VANETS. To evaluate the reliability and performance of the proposed system, we conducted a set of simulations under collusion and non-collusion attacks. The simulation results show that the proposed system is highly resilient to adversarial attacks, no matter whether it is under a fixed silent period (FSP) or random silent period (RSP) location privacy-enhanced scheme. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.","Safety; Self-organized; Trust management; VANET","Accident prevention; Location; Network security; Internal attacker; Protection of privacy; Self-organized; Transportation system; Trust management; Trust management systems; VANET; Vehicle ad-hoc networks; Vehicular ad hoc networks",,,,,"Vehicle Safety Communications Project Task 3 Final Report: Identify intelligent vehicle safety applications enabled by DSRC (2005) National Highwaytraffic Safety Administration; Lin, X., Lu, R., Zhang, C., Zhu, H., Ho, P., Shen, X., Security in vehicular ad hoc networks (2008) IEEE Communications Magazine, 46, pp. 88-95; Haojin, Z., Xiaodong, L., Rongxing, L., Pin-Han, H., Xuemin, S., AEMA: An Aggregated Emergency Message Authentication Scheme for Enhancing the Security of Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (2008) In: IEEE International Conference on Communications, ICC, 2008, pp. 1436-1440; Jie, Z., A Survey on Trust Management for VANETs (2011) 2011 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA, pp. 105-112; Ma, S., Wolfson, O., Lin, J., A survey on trust management for intelligent transportation system (2011) Proceedings of the 4Th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Computational Transportation Science, pp. 18-23. , ACM, Chicago; Leinmüller, T., Maihöfer, C., Schoch, E., Kargl, F., Improved security in geographic ad hoc routing through autonomous position verification (2006) Proceedings of the 3Rd International Workshop on Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks, pp. 57-66. , ACM, Los Angeles; Leinmüller, T., Schoch, E., Kargl, F., Position verification approaches for vehicular ad hoc networks (2006) IEEE Wireless Communications, 13, pp. 16-21; Schmidt, R.K., Leinmüller, T., Schoch, E., Held, A., Schäfer, G., Vehicle Behavior Analysis to Enhance Security in VANETs (2008) 4Th Workshop on Vehicle to Vehicle Communications (V2VCOM, p. 2008. , Eindhoven, The Netherlands; Raya, M., Papadimitratos, P., Aad, I., Jungels, D., Hubaux, J.-P., Eviction of Misbehaving and Faulty Nodes in Vehicular Networks (2007) IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 25, pp. 1557-1568; Ghosh, M., Varghese, A., Gupta, A., Kherani, A.A., Muthaiah, S.N., Detecting misbehaviors in VANET with integrated root-cause analysis (2010) Ad Hoc Networks, 8, pp. 778-790; Dotzer, F., Fischer, L., Magiera, P., VARS: A Vehicle Ad-Hoc Network Reputation System (2005) Proceedings of the Sixth IEEE International Symposium on World of Wireless Mobile and Multimedia Networks, pp. 454-456. , IEEE Computer Society; Wu, Q., Domingo-Ferrer, J., Gonzalez-Nicolas, U., Balanced Trustworthiness, Safety, and Privacy in Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communications (2010) IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 59, pp. 559-573; Ostermaier, B., Dotzer, F., Strassberger, M., Enhancing the Security of Local DangerWarnings in VANETs - A Simulative Analysis of Voting Schemes (2007) Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security, pp. 422-431. , IEEE Computer Society, Vienna; Lo, N.-W., Tsai, H.-C., A Reputation System for Traffic Safety Event on Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (2009) EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking, 2009; Raya, M., Papadimitratos, P., Gligor, V.D., Hubaux, J.-P., On Data-Centric Trust Establishment in Ephemeral Ad Hoc Networks (2008) The 27Th Conference on Computer Communications, INFOCOM 2008, Phoenix, pp. 1238-1246. , IEEE; Kannhavong, B., Nakayama, H., Jamalipour, A., NIS01-2: A Collusion Attack Against OLSR-based Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (2006) Global Telecommunications Conference, GLOBECOM 2006, pp. 1-5; Philippe, G., Dan, G., Jessica, S., Detecting and correcting malicious data in VANETs (2004) Proceedings of the 1St ACM International Workshop on Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks, , ACM, Philadelphia; Chen, C., Jie, Z., Cohen, R., Pin-Han, H., A Trust Modeling Framework for Message Propagation and Evaluation in VANETs (2010) 2010 2Nd International Conference on Information Technology Convergence and Services (ITCS, pp. 1-8; Aslam, B., Park, S., Zou, C., Turgut, D., Secure Traffic Data Propagation in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (2010) Int.

They are emerging as a promising technology in vehicular, planetary/interplanetary, military/tactical, disaster response, underwater and satellite networks. DTNs are characterized by large end-to-end communication latency and the lack of end-to-end path from a source to its destination. These characteristics pose several challenges to the security of DTNs. Especially, Byzantine attacks in which one or more legitimate nodes have been compromised and fully controlled by the adversary can give serious damages to the network in terms of latency and data availability. Using reputation-based trust management systems is shown to be an effective way to handle the adversarial behavior in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs). However, because of the unique characteristics of DTNs, those traditional techniques do not apply to DTNs. Our main objective in this paper is to develop a robust trust mechanism and an efficient and low cost malicious node detection technique for DTNs. Inspired by our recent results on reputation management for online systems and e-commerce, we develop an iterative malicious node detection mechanism for DTNs referred as ITRM. The proposed scheme is a graph-based iterative algorithm motivated by the prior success of message passing techniques for decoding low-density parity-check codes over bipartite graphs. Applying ITRM to DTNs for various mobility models, we observed that the proposed iterative reputation management scheme is far more effective than well-known reputation management techniques such as the Bayesian framework and EigenTrust. Further, we concluded that the proposed scheme provides high data availability and packet-delivery ratio with low latency in DTNs under various adversary attacks which attempt to both undermine the trust and detection scheme and the packet delivery protocol. © 2012 IEEE","delay-tolerant networks; iterative algorithms; malicious node detection; Security; trust and reputation management",,,,,,"Fall, K., A Delay-Tolerant Network Architecture for Challenged Internets (2003) Proc.

It is a critical component for the development of federated identity deployments and Single Sign-On scenarios. In order to protect integrity and authenticity of the exchanged SAML assertions, the XML Signature standard is applied. However, the signature verification algorithm is much more complex than in traditional signature formats like PKCS#7. The integrity protection can thus be successfully circumvented by application of different XML Signature specific attacks, under a weak adversarial model. In this paper we describe an in-depth analysis of 14 major SAML frameworks and show that 11 of them, including Salesforce, Shibboleth, and IBM XS40, have critical XML Signature wrapping (XSW) vulnerabilities. Based on our analysis, we developed an automated penetration testing tool for XSW in SAML frameworks. Its feasibility was proven by additional discovery of a new XSW variant. We propose the first framework to analyze such attacks, which is based on the information flow between two components of the Relying Party. Surprisingly, this analysis also yields efficient and practical countermeasures. Copyright © 2019 21st USENIX Security Symposium.

Though the governments of both nations viewed rising levels of opiate use as a problem, Britain and France took opposite courses of action in addressing the issue. The British sanctioned maintenance treatment for addiction, while the French authorities did not hesitate to take legal action against addicts and the doctors who prescribed drugs to them. Howard Padwa draws on primary documents to examine the factors that led to these disparate approaches. He finds that shifts in the composition of drug-using populations of the two countries and a marked divergence in British and French conceptions of citizenship influenced national policies. Beyond shared concerns about public health and morality, Britain and France understood the threat opiate abuse posed to their respective communities differently. Padwa traces the evolution of thinking on the matter in both countries, explaining why Britain took a less adversarial approach to domestic opiate abuse despite the productivity-sapping powers of this social poison, and why the relatively libertine French chose to attack opiate abuse. In the process, Padwa reveals the confluence of changes in medical knowledge, culture, politics, and drug-user demographics throughout the period, a convergence of forces that at once highlighted the issue and transformed it from one of individual health into a societal concern. An insightful look at the development of drug discourses in the nineteenth century and drug policy in the twentieth century, Social Poison will appeal to scholars and students in public health and the history of medicine. © 2012 The Johns Hopkins University Press.

Integration of Internet Protocol (IP) capabilities allowing for node addressing, data transfer, and communications between systems once considered only Electronic Warfare (EW)-centric, may provide nationstate and non-nation-state adversaries and opportunistic malicious hackers the ability to exploit systems previously considered autonomous. Furthermore, network operations can be affected from wireless and remotely-operating RF systems associated to, or trusted with, operational networks. Basic RF jamming techniques provide an adversary the ability to affect blue force IP over radio communications and data transmissions with little or no risk to themselves by obfuscating their efforts as an Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) layer 2-6 attack rather than a layer 1 attack. The Joint Information Operations Warfare Center (JIOWC) Vulnerability Assessment Team (JVAT) performs adversarial red team tactics against developmental Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations (JCTDs), to include CNE/CNA and RF system of systems. The evolution of 'smart' weapons technologies, to include most information operations (IO) capabilities, now represents the norm in systems development. Command and control (C ) and common operational pictures (COPs) with integrated IP over radio, provide multiple attack vectors and unique opportunities for adversaries. Organizations that manage and develop EW and/or wireless networks must adapt policies and organizational processes to meet the changing environment and to deal with an increasingly savvy adversary who only requires open-source tools and technologies to successfully attack sophisticated RF networked systems. In this paper the authors identify adversarial tactics used against developmental systems with integrated EW and CNO capabilities; using only open-source and publically available equipment, data, and technologies.

By tracking changes in the application's memory footprint, a concurrent process belonging to a different user can learn its secrets. Using Web browsers as the target, we show how an unprivileged, local attack process - for example, a malicious Android app - can infer which page the user is browsing, as well as finer-grained information: whether she is a paid customer, her interests, etc. This attack is an instance of a broader problem. Many isolation mechanisms in modern systems reveal accounting information about program execution, such as memory usage and CPU scheduling statistics. If temporal changes in this public information are correlated with the program's secrets, they can lead to a privacy breach. To illustrate the pervasiveness of this problem, we show how to exploit scheduling statistics for keystroke sniffing in Linux and Android, and how to combine scheduling statistics with the dynamics of memory usage for more accurate adversarial inference of browsing behavior. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Android (operating system); Scheduling; Side channel attack; Web browsers; Accounting informations; Browsing behavior; Concurrent process; Memory footprint; Privacy breaches; Program execution; Public information; Temporal change; Multitasking",,,,,"Asonov, D., Agrawal, R., Keyboard acoustic emanations (2004) S&P; Backes, M., Dürmuth, M., Unruh, D., Compromising reflections - or - how to read LCD monitors around the corner (2008) S&P; Cai, L., Chen, H., TouchLogger: Inferring keystrokes on touch screen from smartphone motion (2011) HotSec; Calandrino, J., Kilzer, A., Narayanan, A., Felten, E., Shmatikov, V., ""You might also like:"" Privacy risks of collaborative filtering (2011) S&P; Chen, S., Wang, R., Wang, X., Zhang, K., Sidechannel leaks in Web applications: A reality today, a challenge tomorrow (2010) S&P; Danezis, G., (2010) Traffic Analysis of the HTTP Protocol over TLS, , http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gdane/papers/TLSanon.pdf; Friedman, J., Tempest: A signal problem (1972) NSA Cryptologic Spectrum; Grier, C., Tang, S., King, S., Secure Web browsing with the OP Web browser (2008) S&P; Hogye, M., Hughes, C., Sarfaty, J., Wolf, J., (2001) Analysis of the Feasibility of Keystroke Timing Attacks over SSH Connections, , Technical Report CS588, University of Virginia, December; Narayanan, A., Shmatikov, V., Robust deanonymization of large sparse datasets (2008) S&P; Padlipsky, M., Snow, D., Karger, D., (1978) Limitations of End-to-end Encryption in Secure Computer Networks, , Technical Report ESD-TR-78-158, MITRE Corporation, August; Peluso, G., (1999) Design Your Application to Manage Performance Data Logs Using the PDH Library, , http://www.microsoft.com/msj/1299/pdh/pdh.aspx; Saponas, S., Lester, J., Hartung, C., Agarwal, S., Kohno, T., Devices that tell on you: Privacy trends in consumer ubiquitous computing (2007) USENIX Security; Schlegel, R., Zhang, K., Zhou, X., Intwala, M., Kapadia, A., Wang, X., Soundcomber: A stealthy and context-aware sound trojan for smartphones (2011) NDSS; Song, D., Wagner, D., Tian, X., Timing analysis of keystrokes and timing attacks on SSH (2001) USENIX Security; Sun, Q., Simon, D., Wang, Y.-M., Russell, W., Padmanabhan, V., Qiu, L., Statistical identification of encrypted Web browsing traffic (2002) S&P; Tsafrir, D., Etsion, Y., Feitelson, D., Secretly monopolizing the CPU without superuser privileges (2007) USENIX Security; Vuagnoux, M., Pasini, S., Compromising electromagnetic emanations of wired and wireless keyboards (2009) USENIX Security; Wright, C., Ballard, L., Coull, S., Monrose, F., Masson, G., Spot me if you can: Uncovering spoken phrases in encrypted VOIP conversations (2008) S&P; Zhang, K., Wang, X., Peeping Tom in the neighborhood: Keystroke eavesdropping on multi-user systems (2009) USENIX Security",,,"IEEE Comput.

The winner of an RTS game usually is the player or team that destroys the opponents' structures first. Unlike abstract board games like chess and go, moves in RTS games are executed simultaneously at a rate of at least eight frames per second. In addition, individual moves in RTS games can consist of issuing simultaneous orders to hundreds of units at any given time. If this wasn't creating enough complexity already, RTS game maps are also usually large and states are only partially observable, with vision restricted to small areas around friendly units and structures. Complexity by itself, of course, is not a convincing motivation for studying RTS games and building AI systems for them. What makes them attractive research subjects is the fact that, despite the perceived complexity, humans are able to outplay machines by means of spatial and temporal reasoning, long-range adversarial planning and plan recognition, state inference, and opponent modeling, which - we hypothesize - are enabled by powerful hierarchical state and action abstractions.

We observe that typical intrusion tolerance techniques may in certain circumstances worsen the dependability properties they were meant to improve. We model intrusions as a probabilistic effect of adversarial efforts and analyze different strategies of attack and rejuvenation. We compare several configurations of intrusion-tolerant replication and proactive rejuvenation, and varying mission times and expected times to node-intrusion. In doing so, we identify thresholds that distinguish between improvement and degradation of dependability, with a focus on security. We highlight the complementarity of replication and rejuvenation, showing improvements of resilience not attainable with any of the techniques alone, but possible when they are combined. We advocate the need for thorougher system models, by showing vulnerabilities arising from incomplete specifications. © 2012 The Brazilian Computer Society.","Availability; Dependability; Intrusion tolerance; Models; Rejuvenation; Reliability; Replication; Resilence; Security; Stealthiness","Endocrinology; Models; Reliability; Dependability; Intrusion tolerance; Rejuvenation; Replication; Resilence; Security; Stealthiness; Availability",,,,,"Avizienis, A., Laprie, J.C., Randell, B., Landwehr, C., Basic concepts and taxonomy of dependable and secure computing (2004) IEEE Trans Dependable Secure Comput, 1, pp. 11-33; Barlow, R.E., Mathematical and statistical methods in reliability (2002) Mathematical Reliability Theory: From the Beginning to the Present Time, 7, pp. 159-175. , Singapore: World Scientific; Bessani, A., Correia, M., Quaresma, B., André, F., Sousa, P., DepSky: dependable and secure storage in a cloud-of-clouds (2011) Proceedings of the 6th Conference on Computer Systems (EuroSys'11), pp. 31-46. , New York: ACM; Bessani, A., Daidone, A., Gashi, I., Obelheiro, R., Sousa, P., Stankovic, V., Enhancing fault/intrusion tolerance through design and configuration diversity (2009) Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Recent Advances on Intrusion-Tolerant Systems (WRAITS'09); Brandão, L.T.A.N., Bessani, A., On the reliability and availability of systems tolerant to stealth intrusion (2011) Proceedings of the 5th Latin-American Symposium on Dependable Computing (LADC 2011), pp. 35-44. , Los Alamitos: IEEE Computer Society; Castro, M., Liskov, B., Practical Byzantine fault tolerance and proactive recovery (2002) ACM Trans Comput Syst, 20, pp. 398-461; Correia, M., Neves, N.F., Veríssimo, P., How to tolerate half less one byzantine nodes in practical distributed systems (2004) Proceedings of the 23rd IEEE International Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems (SRDS'04), pp. 174-183. , Washington: IEEE Computer Society; Daidone, A., Chiaradonna, S., Bondavalli, A., Veríssimo, P., Analysis of a redundant architecture for critical infrastructure protection (2008) Architecting Dependable Systems V, 5135, pp. 78-100. , Lecture notes in computer science, R.

Often, the governments and industries responsible for the critical infrastructures are unaware of the extension and integration of the ""web"" on which their infrastructures rely. The safety of the citizens and the economies of these countries rely on the continuous operation of these systems to provide the services vital to the country and its people. The proliferation of interconnectivity and dependencies of these critical infrastructure systems has led to vulnerabilities, with attacks possible against nearly every country's critical infrastructures from nearly anywhere in the world. The vulnerable infrastructures' systems include banking and financial institutions, transportation systems, electricity and natural gas generation and distribution, petroleum distribution, and phone and cell communications. The threats may originate from unintended incidents, attacks by criminals, terrorists, and adversarial foreign nations with malicious intent, any of which could cause significant damage, bringing the critical systems to a halt. This literature review looks at various aspects of critical infrastructures and the governmental approaches to address the problem of government dependency on the private sector's ownership and control of critical infrastructures. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","critical infrastructures; cyber attack; cyberspace; IT security; terrorism","Cell communication; Continuous operation; Critical infrastructure systems; Critical systems; Cyber-attacks; Cyberspaces; Financial institution; Foreign nations; Gas generation; Industrialized countries; Interconnectivity; IT security; Literature reviews; Private sectors; System of systems; Transportation system; Cellular telephone systems; Critical infrastructures; Security of data; Security systems; Terrorism; Public works",,,,,"Anonymous, Immunizing the Internet, or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the worm (2006) Harvard Law Review, 119 (8), pp. 2442-2463; Brown, T.A., Legal propriety of protecting defense industrial base information infrastructure (2009) Air Force Law Review, 64, pp. 211-257; Canestraro, D.S., Pardo, T.A., Raup-Kounovsky, A.N., Taratus, D., Regional telecommunication incident coordination: Sharing information for rapid response (2009) Information Polity: The International Journal of Government & Democracy in the Information Age, 14, pp. 113-126; Cannoy, S., Palvia, P.C., Schilhavy, R., A research framework for information systems security (2006) Journal of Information Privacy & Security, 2, pp. 3-29; Chittester, C.G., Haimes, Y.Y., Risks of terrorism to information technology and to critical interdependent infrastructures (2004) Journal of Homeland Security & Emergency Management, 1, pp. 1-20; Dhillon, G., Realizing benefits of an information security program (2004) Business Process Management Journal, 10 (3), pp. 260-261; Dhillon, J.S., Smith, R.I., Defensive information operations and domestic law: Limitations on government investigative techniques (2001) Air Force Law Review, 50, p. 135; Dutton, W., Guerra, G.A., Zizzo, D.J., Peltu, M., The cyber trust tension in e-government: Balancing identity, privacy, security (2005) Information Polity: The International Journal of Government & Democracy in the Information Age, 10, pp. 13-23; Geers, K., The cyber threat to national critical infrastructures: Beyond theory (2009) Information Security Journal: A Global Perspective, 18, pp. 1-7; Gill, P., Securing the globe: Intelligence and the post-9/11 shift from ""Liddism"" to ""Drainism.""

Our game-theoretic model follows common practice in the security literature by making worst case assumptions about the attacker: we grant the attacker complete knowledge of the defender's strategy and do not require the attacker to act rationally. In this model, we bound the competitive ratio between a reactive defense algorithm (which is inspired by online learning theory) and the best fixed proactive defense. Additionally, we show that, unlike proactive defenses, this reactive strategy is robust to a lack of information about the attacker's incentives and knowledge. © 2012 IEEE.","adversarial learning; attack graphs; game theory.; online learning; Reactive security; risk management","Game theory; Network security; Risk management; Adversarial learning; Attack graph; Competitive ratio; Game-theoretic model; Learning-based approach; Online learning; Proactive security; Reactive security; E-learning",,,,,"Pironti, J.P., Key elements of an information security program (2005) Information Systems Control J., 1; Kark, K., Penn, J., Dill, A., 2008 CISO priorities: The right objectives but the wrong focus (2009) Le Magazine de la Sécurité Informatique, , Apr; Beard, C., (2008) Introducing Test Pilot, , http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/03/introducing-test-pilot/, Mar; Cremonini, M., Evaluating information security investments from attackers perspective: The Return-On-Attack (ROA) (2005) Proc.

Any entity operating in cyberspace is susceptible to debilitating cyber attacks. As part of the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace, the United States acknowledges that the speed and anonymity of cyber attacks makes distinguishing among the actions of terrorists, criminals, and nation states difficult. Indeed, today{quoteright}s Internet is an incredibly effective, uncontrolled weapon for eavesdropping and spying. Therefore, anonymity and privacy are increasingly important issues. A plethora of existing or proposed anonymous networks achieve diverse levels of anonymity against a variety of adversarial attacks. However, no known taxonomy provides a comprehensive classification of the varied set of wired, wireless, and hybrid anonymous communications networks. We develop a novel cubic taxonomy to facilitate the systematic definition and classification of anonymity in anonymous communications networks. Three key anonymity components: anonymity property, adversary capability, and network type are thoroughly explored. More importantly, an in-depth description of a new tree-based taxonomy for the state-of-the-art in wireless anonymous protocols is offered. For completeness, a tree-based taxonomy of wired and hybrid anonymous protocols are also provided. Lastly, several evolving anonymity metrics which quantify anonymity preservation, degradation, and elimination in existing and future anonymous networks are examined. Hence, this paper explores extant and emerging issues in anonymous networks via an intuitive taxonomy and surveys anonymous protocols and quantifiable metrics essential for any entity determined to assure anonymity and preserve privacy in cyberspace against an adversary. © 1998-2012 IEEE.","Anonymity; anonymity metrics; security; taxonomy; wired networks; wireless networks","Anonymity; Anonymity and privacy; anonymity metrics; Anonymity property; Anonymous communication; Anonymous Networks; Anonymous protocol; Cyber-attacks; Cyberspaces; National strategies; Network types; security; Tree-based; Wired networks; Computers; Crime; Degradation; Forestry; Internet protocols; Network security; Surveys; Wireless networks; Taxonomies; Communication; Computation; Degradation; Forestry; Internet; Neural Networks; Safety",,,,,"Boyan, J., The anonymizer (1997) CMC Magazine; Reiter, M., Rubin, A., Crowds: Anonymity for web transactions (1998) ACM Trans.
