We provide a systematic approach rooted from information theory to evaluate basic performance limits of RF fingerprinting. We develop a novel channel model for RF fingerprinting, where the imperfections in the RF chain are modeled as a fingerprint channel, cascaded to the actual physical channel. We address the authentication problem in the presence of an adversary, where both the legitimate transmitter and the adversary are equipped with unique fingerprint channels, in addition to a possible secret key available at the legitimate nodes. We provide achievable bounds for the error exponents for reliable communication of the legitimate nodes, and the success exponent for impersonation and substitution attacks of the adversary, as a function of certain parameters based on their RF-fingerprints, and the shared key rate. We illustrate that keyless authentication is possible via RF fingerprints when the legitimate channel is not simulatable. © 2014 IEEE.",,Authentication; Information theory; Radio stations; Radio transmission; Transmitters; Channel model; Error exponent; Legitimate channels; Performance limits; Physical channels; Reliable communication; RF fingerprints; Substitution attack; Network security,,,,,"Black, J., Halevi, S., Krawczyk, H., Krovetz, T., Rogaway, P., Umac: Fast and secure message authentication (1999) Advances in Cryptology-CRYPTO99, pp. 216-233. , Springer; Xiao, L., Greenstein, L., Mandayam, N., Trappe, W., Fingerprints in the ether: Using the physical layer for wireless authentication (2007) Communications, 2007.

Electrical and Electronic Eng., University College Cork, Cork, Ireland","Side-channel analysis of cryptographic systems can allow for the recovery of secret information by an adversary even where the underlying algorithms have been shown to be provably secure. This is achieved by exploiting the unintentional leakages inherent in the underlying implementation of the algorithm in software or hardware. Within this field of research, a class of attacks known as profiling attacks, or more specifically as used here template attacks, have been shown to be extremely efficient at extracting secret keys. Template attacks assume a strong adversarial model, in that an attacker has an identical device with which to profile the power consumption of various operations. This can then be used to efficiently attack the target device. Inherent in this assumption is that the power consumption across the devices under test is somewhat similar. This central tenet of the attack is largely unexplored in the literature with the research community generally performing the profiling stage on the same device as being attacked. This is beneficial for evaluation or penetration testing as it is essentially the best case scenario for an attacker where the model built during the profiling stage matches exactly that of the target device, however it is not necessarily a reflection on how the attack will work in reality. In this work, a large scale evaluation of this assumption is performed, comparing the key recovery performance across 20 identical smart-cards when performing a profiling attack. © 2014 IEEE.",,Electric power utilization; Signal processing; Silicon compounds; Smart cards; Cryptographic systems; Devices under tests; Empirical evaluations; Penetration testing; Research communities; Secret information; Side-channel analysis; Template Attacks; Side channel attack,,,,,"Kocher, P.C., Timing attacks on implementations of diffie-hellman, RSA, DSS, and other systems (1996) Advances in Cryptology - CRYPTO 1996, pp. 104-113. , ser.

Trust and reputation models generate an accurate assessment for each identity in networks to provide enough information about the service provider and about how good the services offered. However the performance of a trust and reputation model may decline in potentially adversarial environments. In this paper, firstly, we listed a number of security threats applicable in the field of trust and reputation management. Secondly, we proposed statistical anomalies detection algorithms to cope with these threats. Finally, based on ant colony theory we designed a trust and reputation model, named AraTRM, and integrated these algorithms into AraTRM to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed anomalies detection algorithms. Experimental results have shown that the proposed model is robust in adversarial environments and achieves high accuracy as well. © 2014 IEEE.",Ant-based; Attack-resistible; Security; Trust,Anomaly detection; Ant colony optimization; Signal detection; Adversarial environments; Ant-based; Attack-resistible; Detection algorithm; Security; Trust; Trust and reputation; Trust and reputation managements; Network security,,,,,"Jøsang, A., Ismail, R., The beta reputation system (2002) Proceedings of the 15th Bled Electronic Commerce Conference, , June; Carbone, M., Nielsen, M., Sassone, V., A Formal model for trust in dynamic networks (2003) Proc. of International Conference on Software Engineering and Formal Methods (SEFM'03), , Brisbane, September; Jøsang, A., Hird, S., Faccer, E., Simulating the effect of reputation systems on e-markets (2003) P.Nixon and S.Terzis, Editors, Proceedings of the First International Conference on Trust Management (ITrust), , Crete, May; Sabater, J., Sierra, C., Social ReGreT, a reputation model based on social relations (2002) SIGecom Exchanges, 3 (1), pp. 44-56; Ziegler, C.-N., Lausen, G., Spreading activation models for trust propagation (2004) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on E-Technology, E-Commerce, and E-Service (EEE ' 04), , Taipei, March; Mármol, F.G., Pérez, G.M., Providing trust in wireless sensor networks using a bio-inspired technique (2011) Telecommunication Systems, 46 (2), pp. 163-180; Mármol, F.G., Marín-Blázquez, J.G., Pérez, G.M., LFTM, linguistic fuzzy trust mechanism for distributed networks (2012) Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience 24, 17, pp. 2007-2027; Dorigo, M., Gambardella, L., Ant colony system: A cooperative learning approach in the traveling salesman problem (1997) IEEE Transaction on Evolutionary Computing, 1 (1), pp. 53-66; Hoffman, K., Zage, D., Nita-Rotaru, C., A survey of attack and defense techniques for reputation systems (2009) ACM Comput.

Software virtualization has given rise to advanced techniques that may provide intellectual property protection and anti-cloning resilience. We present results of an empirical study that answers whether integrity of execution can be preserved for process-level virtualization protection schemes in the face of adversarial analysis. Our particular approach considers exploits that target the virtual execution environment itself and how it interacts with the underlying host operating system and hardware. We give initial results that indicate such protection mechanisms may be vulnerable at the level where the virtualized code interacts with the underlying operating system. The resolution of whether such attacks can undermine security will help create better detection and analysis methods for malware that also employ software virtualization. Our findings help frame research for additional mitigation techniques using hardware-based integration or hybrid virtualization techniques that can better defend legitimate uses of virtualized software protection.

One of the main challenges in designing SDN enabled switches is efficient packet classification in the data plane. As the complexity of SDN applications increases, the data plane becomes more susceptible to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, which can result in increased delays and packet loss. Accordingly, there is a strong need for network architectures that operate efficiently in the presence of malicious traffic. In particular, there is a need to protect authorized flows from DoS attacks. In this work we utilize a probabilistic data structure to pre-classify traffic with the aim of decoupling likely legitimate traffic from malicious traffic by leveraging the locality of packet flows. We validate our approach by examining a fundamental SDN application: software defined network firewall. For this application, our architecture dramatically reduces the impact of unknown/malicious flows on established/legitimate flows. We explore the effect of stochastic pre-classification in prioritizing data plane classification. We show how pre-classification can be used to increase the effective Quality of Service (QoS) for established flows and reduce the impact of adversarial traffic. © 2014 IEEE.",,Application programs; Computer system firewalls; Denial-of-service attack; Network architecture; Network protocols; Packet networks; Quality of service; Stochastic systems; Denial of Service; Malicious traffic; Network condition; Network state; Packet classification; Packet flows; Probabilistic data; Software defined networking (SDN); Classification (of information),,,,,"Biggest DDoS Attack' Did Not Hurt the Global Internet-This Time, , http://www.techweekeurope.co.uk/news/biggest-cyber-Attackddos-spamhaus-security-networks-111690, Retrieved June 15, 2014 from; The CAIDA Anonymized 2012 Internet Traces-2012, Kc Claffy, , http://www.caida.org/data/passive/passive2012.dataset.xml, Dan Andersen, Paul Hick; (2014) Open Networking Foundation, , https://www.opennetworking.org, Retrieved June 15 from; Bosshart, P., Gibb, G., Kim, H.-S., Varghese, G., Mckeown, N., Izzard, M., Mujica, F., Horowitz, M., Forwarding metamorphosis: Fast programmable match-action processing in hardware for sdn (2013) Proceedings of the ACM SIGCOMM 2013 Conference on SIGCOMM, SIGCOMM '13, pp. 99-110. , New York, NY, USA ACM; Broder, A., Mitzenmacher, M., Broder, A., Mitzenmacher, M., Network applications of bloom filters: A survey (2002) Internet Mathematics, pp. 636-646; Chvets, I.L., MacGregor, M.H., Multi-zone caches for accelerating ip routing table lookups (2002) Workshop on High Performance Switching and Routing, Merging Optical and IP Technologies, pp. 121-126; Ghoshal, P., Jasson Casey, C., Gratz, P.V., Sprintson, A., Stochastic pre-classification for software defined firewalls (2013) Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN 2013 22nd International Conference on, pp. 1-8. , IEEE; Gupta, P., McKeown, N., Classifying packets with hierarchical intelligent cuttings (2000) Micro IEEE, 20, pp. 34-41. , Jan/Feb; Gupta, P., McKeown, N., Algorithms for packet classification (2001) IEEE Network, 15, pp. 24-32. , Mar/Apr; Li, K., Chang, F., Berger, D., Feng, W., Architectures for packet classification caching (2003) Proceedings of the 11th IEEE International Conference on Networks (ICon, pp. 111-117. , Sept/Oct; Muralimanohar, N., Balasubramonian, R., Jouppi, N.P., Jouppi.

As a consequence, privacy concerns are raising year by year. Location privacy is becoming a major interest in research and industry world, and many solutions have been proposed for it. One of the simplest and most flexible approaches is obfuscation, in which the precision of location data is artificially degraded before disclosing it. In this paper, we present an obfuscation approach capable of dealing with measurement imprecision, multiple levels of privacy, untrusted servers and adversarial knowledge of the map. We estimate its resistance against statistical-based deobfuscation attacks, and we improve it by means of three techniques, namely extreme vectors, enlarge-and-scale and hybrid vectors. © 2015 The British Computer Society 2015.

A malicious adversary may enter the network and arbitrarily corrupt transmissions. A very general model is adopted for the scope of attack: a collection of sets of edges is specified, and the adversary may control any one set of edges in this collection. The adversary is assumed to be omniscient but causal, such that the adversary is forced to decide on transmissions before knowing random choices by the honest nodes. Four main results are presented. First, a precise characterization of whether any positive rate can be achieved. Second, a simple erasure upper bound. Third, an achievable bound wherein random hashes are generated and distributed, so that nodes in the network can filter out adversarial corruption. Finally, an example network is presented that has capacity strictly between the general upper and lower bounds. © 2014 IEEE.",,Active attack; General model; In networks; Malicious adversaries; Multicast network; Random choice; Upper and lower bounds; Upper Bound; Information theory,,,,,"Yeung, R.W., Cai, N., Network error correction, part i: Basic concepts and upper bounds (2006) Comm. in Inf. and Syst., 6 (1), pp. 19-36; Cai, N., Yeung, R.W., Network error correction, part ii: Lower bounds (2006) Comm. in Inf. and Syst., 6 (1), pp. 37-54; Jaggi, S., Langberg, M., Ho, T., Effros, M., Correction of adversarial errors in networks (2005) Proc.

This integration however exposes the physical system functioning to the security vulnerabilities of cyber communication. Both scientific studies and real world examples have demonstrated the impact of data injection attacks on state estimation mechanisms on the smart electricity grid. In this work, an abstract theoretical framework is proposed to study data injection/modification attacks on Markov modeled dynamical systems from the perspective of an adversary. Typical data injection attacks focus on one shot attacks by adversary and the non-detectability of such attacks under static assumptions. In this work we study dynamic data injection attacks where the adversary is capable of modifying a temporal sequence of data and the physical controller is equipped with prior statistical knowledge about the data arrival process to detect the presence of an adversary. The goal of the adversary is to modify the arrivals to minimize a utility function of the controller while minimizing the detectability of his presence as measured by the KL divergence between the prior and posterior distribution of the arriving data. Adversarial policies and tradeoffs between utility and detectability are characterized analytically using linearly solvable control optimization. © 2014 IEEE.",,Commerce; Dynamical systems; Electric power transmission networks; Embedded systems; Information theory; Network security; Advanced manufacturing; Cyber infrastructures; Physical controllers; Posterior distributions; Security vulnerabilities; Statistical knowledge; Theoretical framework; Transportation network; Smart power grids,,,,,"Kosut, O., Jia, L., Thomas, R.J., Tong, L., Malicious data attacks on smart grid state estimation: Attack strategies and countermeasures (2010) Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm), 2010 First IEEE International Conference On.

In addition to downing the grid, cyber attacks can also destroy and manipulate data systems, obtain sensitive intellectual property and steal trade secrets. Existing research has addressed the technical factors, such as vulnerabilities and poor intrusion detection systems, which lead to cyber attacks. However, it remains silent on the human factors in the cyber attack equation. This study uses a criminological framework, specifically Routine Activities Theory and Rational Choice Perspective to capture intelligent adversaries who plan and execute attacks based on their analysis of target suitability and guardianship efficacy. It uses a two-step methodology to identify adversary-, target-, and guardianship-specific factors that collectively impact decision-making processes. First, a document analysis of existing literature reveals nine factors (PARE RISKS) that influence adversarial decision-making: Prevention measures, Attacks and Alliances, Results, Ease of Access, Response and Recovery, Interconnectedness and Interdependencies, Security Testing, Assessments and Audits, Knowledge, Skills, Research and Development, and System Weaknesses. Second, surveys and interviews conducted between 2010 and 2012 with various hackers, penetration testers, and power grid representatives helps validate and refine the PARE RISKS framework. This study identifies (i) adversary-specific factors as resources (skills, money, and time), and research (targets and techniques); (ii) target-specific factors as accessibility (electronic and physical) and weaknesses (outdated architecture and inadequate testing/updates); and (iii) guardian-specific factors as prevention (quality of prevention and intrusion detection measures). It argues that altering each of these three elements of Routine Activities Theory can impact adversarial decisionmaking, which may help reduce the likelihood of power grid cyber attacks.",Adversarial decision-making; Power grid cyber attacks; Rational Choice Perspective; Routine activities theory,,,,,,"BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation), US and Israel were behind stuxnet claims researcher (2011) BBC, , http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12633240, March 4. accessed August 17, 2011; Bernard, T., Snipes, J., Gerould, A., (2010) VOLD's Theoretical Criminology, , 6th edition, North Carolina: Oxford University Press; Broad, W., Markoff, J., Sanger, D., Israeli test on worm called crucial in Iran nuclear delay (2011) New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/world/middleeast/16stuxnet.html, January 15. accessed August 17, 2011; Bumiller, E., Shanker, T., Panetta warns of dire threat of cyber attack on U.

Recently, the use of seam-carving, a content-aware resizing method, has been proposed to anonymize the source camera of images against the well-known photoresponse nonuniformity (PRNU)-based source attribution technique. In this paper, we provide an analysis of the seam-carving-based source camera anonymization method by determining the limits of its performance introducing two adversarial models. Our analysis shows that the effectiveness of the deanonymization attacks depend on various factors that include the parameters of the seam-carving method, strength of the PRNU noise pattern of the camera, and an adversary's ability to identify uncarved image blocks in a seam-carved image. Our results show that, for the general case, there should not be many uncarved blocks larger than the size of 50 × 50 pixels for successful anonymization of the source camera. © 2014 IEEE.",PRNU noise pattern; seam-carving; source attribution,Anonymization; Content-aware; Deanonymization; Photoresponse nonuniformity; PRNU noise; seam-carving; Source attribution; Source attribution techniques; Cameras,,,,,"Sencar, H.T., Memon, N., (2013) Digital Image Forensics: There is More to A Picture Than Meets the Eye, , New York NY USA: Springer-Verlag; Lukáš, J., Fridrich, J., Goljan, M., Digital camera identification from sensor pattern noise (2006) IEEE Trans.

To avoid the unregulated spread of such material many copy detectors have been developed in order to deny the possibility to upload, and consequently make available, copies of copyrighted contents. A widely referenced fingerprint method for content-based audio identification is the Philips Robust Hash (PRH). This paper introduces a simple but effective attack technique capable to defeat a PRH fingerprint-based audio copy detector without significantly affecting the signal quality. It is a heuristic method that adds a suitable distortion to the original audio signal, so that the modified signal is not detected as a copy of the original one but is perceptively very similar to it. The quality of the modified signal has been evaluated in terms of a distortion measure based on a mathematical model of the human auditory system and of the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). The attack method has shown a promising success rate. © 1994-2012 IEEE.",Adversarial signal processing; audio fingerprint; copy detection attack; Copyright protection,,,,,,"Haitsma, J., Kalker, T., A highly robust audio fingerprinting system (2002) 3rd International Conf.

However, if they are deployed online, an attacker may attempt to evade them by manipulating the data. Examples of such attacks have been previously studied under the assumption that an attacker has full knowledge about the deployed classifier. In practice, such assumptions rarely hold, especially for systems deployed online. A significant amount of information about a deployed classifier system can be obtained from various sources. In this paper, we experimentally investigate the effectiveness of classifier evasion using a real, deployed system, PDFrate, as a test case. We develop a taxonomy for practical evasion strategies and adapt known evasion algorithms to implement specific scenarios in our taxonomy. Our experimental results reveal a substantial drop of PDFrate's classification scores and detection accuracy after it is exposed even to simple attacks. We further study potential defense mechanisms against classifier evasion. Our experiments reveal that the original technique proposed for PDFrate is only effective if the executed attack exactly matches the anticipated one. In the discussion of the findings of our study, we analyze some potential techniques for increasing robustness of learning-based systems against adversarial manipulation of data. © 2014 IEEE.",,Taxonomies; Amount of information; Classifier systems; Defense mechanism; Deployed systems; Detection accuracy; Evasion strategy; Potential techniques; Test case; Online systems,,,,,"Bayer, U., Comparetti, P., Hlauschek, C., Kruegel, C., Kirda, E., Scalable, behavior-based malware clustering (2009) Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS); Thonnard, O., (2010) A Multicriteria Clustering Approach to Support Attack Attribution in Cyberspace, , Ph.D. dissertation, Ecole Doctorale d'Informatique, Télécommunications et Electronique de Paris; Cova, M., Kruegel, C., Vigna, G., Detection and analysis of driveby-download attacks and malicious Java Script code (2010) International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), pp. 281-290; Rajab, M.A., Ballard, L., Lutz, N., Mavrommatis, P., Provos, N., CAMP: Content-agnostic malware protection (2013) Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS); Canali, D., Cova, M., Vigna, G., Kruegel, C., Prophiler: A fast filter for the large-scale detection of malicious web pages (2011) International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), pp. 197-206; Stringhini, G., Kruegel, C., Vigna, G., Shady paths: Leveraging surfing crowds to detect malicious web pages (2013) ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS), pp. 133-144; Egele, M., Stringhini, G., Kruegel, C., Vigna, G., COMPA: Detecting compromised accounts on social networks (2013) Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS); Freeman, D.M., Using naive bayes to detect spammy names in social networks (2013) ACM Workshop on AI and Security (AISec), pp. 3-12; Rahbarinia, B., Perdisci, R., Lanzi, A., Li, K., Peerrush: Mining for unwanted p2p traffic (2013) Detection of Intrusions and Malware & Vulnerability Assessment (DIMVA), pp. 62-82; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Joseph, A., Tygar, J., The security of machine learning (2010) Machine Learning, 81 (2), pp. 121-148; Kearns, M., Li, M., Learning in the presence of malicious errors (1993) SIAM Journal on Computing, 22 (4), pp. 807-837; Brückner, M., Kanzow, C., Scheffer, T., Static prediction games for adversarial learning problems (2012) Journal of Machine Learning Research, pp. 2617-2654; Kloft, M., Laskov, P., Security analysis of online centroid anomaly detection (2012) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 13, pp. 3133-3176; Biggio, B., Fumera, G., Roli, F., Security evaluation of pattern classifiers under attack (2013) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 99, p. 1. , PrePrints; Fogla, P., Sharif, M., Perdisci, R., Kolesnikov, O., Lee, W., Polymorphic blending attacks (2006) USENIX Security Symposium, pp. 241-256; Perdisci, R., Dagon, D., Lee, W., Fogla, P., Sharif, M., Misleading worm signature generators using deliberate noise injection (2006) IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 17-31; Biggio, B., Nelson, B., Laskov, P., Poisoning attacks against support vector machines (2012) International Conference on Machine Learning; Lindell, Y., Pinkas, B., Privacy preserving data mining (2000) International Cryptology Conference on Advances in Cryptology (CRYPTO), pp. 36-54; Dwork, C., Differential privacy: A survey of results (2008) International Conference on Theory and Applications of Models of Computation (TAMC), pp. 1-19; Fogla, P., Lee, W., Evading network anomaly detection systems: Formal reasoning and practical techniques (2006) ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 59-68; Lowd, D., Meek, C., Good word attacks on statistical spam filters (2005) Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 641-647; Biggio, B., Corona, I., Maiorca, D., Nelson, B., Šrndić, N., Laskov, P., Giacinto, G., Roli, F., Evasion attacks against machine learning at test time (2013) European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-40994-325, [Online]; Smutz, C., Stavrou, A., Malicious PDF detection using metadata and structural features (2012) Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC), pp. 239-248; Smutz, C., Stavrou, A., (2012) Malicious PDF Detection Using Metadata and Structural Features, , http://cs.gmu.edu, Department of Computer Science, George Mason University, 4400 University Drive MSN 4A5, Fairfax, VA 22030-4444 USA, Tech.

Distributed systems, mobile and desktop applications, embedded devices, and all of secure Web rely on SSL/TLS for protection against network attacks. This protection critically depends on whether SSL/TLS clients correctly validate X.509 certificates presented by servers during the SSL/TLS handshake protocol. We design, implement, and apply the first methodology for large-scale testing of certificate validation logic in SSL/TLS implementations. Our first ingredient is ""frankencerts,"" synthetic certificates that are randomly mutated from parts of real certificates and thus include unusual combinations of extensions and constraints. Our second ingredient is differential testing: if one SSL/TLS implementation accepts a certificate while another rejects the same certificate, we use the discrepancy as an oracle for finding flaws in individual implementations. Differential testing with frankencerts uncovered 208 discrepancies between popular SSL/TLS implementations such as OpenSSL, NSS, CyaSSL, GnuTLS, PolarSSL, MatrixSSL, etc. Many of them are caused by serious security vulnerabilities. For example, any server with a valid X.509 version1 certificate can act as a rogue certificate authority and issue fake certificates for any domain, enabling man-in-the-middle attacks against MatrixSSL and GnuTLS. Several implementations also accept certificate authorities created by unauthorized issuers, as well as certificates not intended for server authentication. We also found serious vulnerabilities in how users are warned about certificate validation errors. When presented with an expired, self-signed certificate, NSS, Safari, and Chrome (on Linux) report that the certificate has expired - a low-risk, often ignored error - but not that the connection is insecure against a man-in-the-middle attack. These results demonstrate that automated adversarial testing with frankencerts is a powerful methodology for discovering security flaws in SSL/TLS implementations. © 2014 IEEE.",automated testing; certificate validation; SSL,Automation; Computer operating systems; Distributed database systems; Embedded systems; Network protocols; Automated testing; Certificate validations; Man in the middle attacks; Secure sockets layers; Security vulnerabilities; Self-signed certificate; Server authentication; Transport layer security protocols; Network security,,,,,"Akhawe, D., Amann, B., Vallentin, M., Sommer, R., Here's my cert, so trust me, maybe?

Synchronization between a transmitter and receiver is required for coherent demodulation of OFDM symbols, but this process is extremely fragile and susceptible to attacks from malicious third parties. Carrier frequency offset estimation and correction in particular is both prerequisite to demodulation and extremely sensitive to errors. In this work, we address security concerns and assess the performance of the popular maximum likelihood (ML) estimation algorithm developed in [1] in the presence of adversarial communications systems.

However, the suitability of clustering algorithms for security-sensitive settings has been recently questioned by showing that they can be significantly compromised if an attacker can exercise some control over the input data. In this paper, we revisit this problem by focusing on behavioral malware clustering approaches, and investigate whether and to what extent an attacker may be able to subvert these approaches through a careful injection of samples with poisoning behavior. To this end, we present a case study on Malheur, an open-source tool for behavioral malware clustering. Our experiments not only demonstrate that this tool is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, but also that it can be significantly compromised even if the attacker can only inject a very small percentage of attacks into the input data. As a remedy, we discuss possible countermeasures and highlight the need for more secure clustering algorithms. © 2014 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.

Given its widespread presence throughout different software platforms, JavaScript is a primary tool for the development of novel rapidly evolving malicious exploits. If the classical signature- And heuristic-based detection approaches are clearly inadequate to cope with this kind of threat, machine learning solutions proposed so far suffer from high falsealarm rates or require special instrumentation that make them not suitable for protecting end-user systems. In this paper we present Lux0R Lux 0n discriminant References"", a novel, lightweight approach to the detection of malicious JavaScript code. Our method is based on the characterization of JavaScript code through its API references, i.e., functions, constants, objects, methods, keywords as well as attributes natively recognized by a JavaScript Application Programming Interface (API). We exploit machine learning techniques to select a subset of API references that characterize malicious code, and then use them to detect JavaScript malware. The selection algorithm has been thought to be secure by design"" against evasion by mimicry attacks. In this investigation, we focus on a relevant application domain, i.e., the detection of malicious JavaScript code within PDF documents. We show that our technique is able to achieve excellent malware detection accuracy, even on samples exploiting never-before-seen vulnerabilities, i.e., for which there are no examples in training data. Finally, we experimentally assess the robustness of Lux0R against mimicry attacks based on feature addition.",Adversarial machine learning; Javascript code; Malware detection; Mimicry attacks; PDF documents,Application programming interfaces (API); Codes (symbols); Computer systems programming; Discriminant analysis; Dynamic programming; High level languages; Machine learning; Websites; Javascript; Machine learning techniques; Malicious javascript; Malware detection; Mimicry attacks; PDF document; Selection algorithm; Software platforms; Malware,,,,,"JavaScript for Acrobat API Reference, , Http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/js_api_reference.pdf, Adobe Systems Inc.- Last visited December 6, 2013, April 2007; Albertini, A., (2013) Pdftricks: A Summary of Pdf Tricks - Encodings, Structures, Javascript, , https://code.google.com/p/corkami/wiki/PDFTricks, March, Corkami Wiki; Biggio, B., Corona, I., Maiorca, D., Nelson, B., Srndic, N., Laskov, P., Giacinto, G., Roli, F., Evasion attacks against machine learning at test time (2013) European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases, , H.

Conservatively, make confident the uniqueness of the conversationalist and perceiving an adversarial or attackers presence is executed through cryptographic validation. Unfortunately, verification of the uniqueness or identity is not constantly enviable as it necessitates key service management, and also coupled with extra infrastructural visual projection and more general calculations. So that it has been proposed, which are corresponding to validate and can perceive wireless device spoofing with diminutive or no dependency on cryptographic technique i.e., without using the digital signature. So that we proposed the efficient algorithm to identify the spoofing or mockery of information and these kind of attacks in the wireless networks. There are many techniques proposed previously to tackle the false information injection, Identity theft attacks and IP spoofing in the wireless networks. In order to overcome the obstacles in the previously proposed methods, we implement effective algorithm for the authentication process or verification and filtering of the MAC addresses of the Roger wireless devices. Our proposed method has consisted of two main implementation parts to address the spoofing attacks. One part is to identify the uniqueness of the client address and other is to make the modification access point control list in each client. Through our proposed technique, recognize of spoofing or mockery of information attacks in wireless networks in the effective way and also helps to identify the adversaries using same uniqueness of the nodes in the wireless networks. Our proposed model can be explored added to get better the accuracy of determining the attacks in the wireless networks, by using non cryptographic technique when compared to others. Our proposed scheme works effectively when compared to the previous system is shown through our implementation and results. © 2014 IEEE.",Attack detection; Hashing; Identity-Based Attack; MAC address spoofing; MAC frame header; Spoofing Attack; Wireless network security,Ad hoc networks; Authentication; Cryptography; Signal processing; Wireless networks; Attack detection; Frame header; Hashing; Identity-based; Mac address spoofing; Spoofing attacks; Network security,,,,,"Yang, J., Chen, Y., Trappe, W., Detecting spoofing attacks in mobile wireless environments (2009) Proc.

Under such adversarial environments, adversaries can generate exploratory attacks against the defender such as evasion and reverse engineering. In this paper, we discuss why reverse engineering attacks can be carried out quite efficiently against fixed classifiers, and investigate the use of randomization as a suitable strategy for mitigating their risk. In particular, we derive a semidefinite programming (SDP) formulation for learning a distribution of classifiers subject to the constraint that any single classifier picked at random from such distribution provides reliable predictions with a high probability. We analyze the tradeoff between variance of the distribution and its predictive accuracy, and establish that one can almost always incorporate randomization with large variance without incurring a loss in accuracy. In other words, the conventional approach of using a fixed classifier in adversarial environments is generally Pareto suboptimal. Finally, we validate such conclusions on both synthetic and real-world classification problems.

In this paper, we analyze the security of the Estonian I-voting system based on a combination of in-person election observation, code review, and adversarial testing. Adopting a threat model that considers the advanced threats faced by a national election system-including dishonest insiders and state-sponsored attacks-we find that the I-voting system has serious architectural limitations and procedural gaps that potentially jeopardize the integrity of elections. In experimental attacks on a reproduction of the system, we demonstrate how such attackers could target the election servers or voters' clients to alter election results or undermine the legitimacy of the system. Our findings illustrate the practical obstacles to Internet voting in the modern world, and they carry lessons for Estonia, for other countries considering adopting such systems, and for the security research community.

In cases where a system fault occurs, administrators often find themselves needing to answer attribution questions, to perform a variety of managerial tasks including system debugging, accountability enforcement, and attack analysis. In this chapter, we propose Secure Time-Aware Provenance (STAP), a data-centric approach that provides the fundamental functionality required to answer such attribution questions-the capability to explain the existence (or change) of a certain distributed system state at a given time in a potentially adversarial environment. The proposed STAP model allows consistent and complete explanations of system state (and changes) in dynamic environments, and can be efficiently maintained and queried even in potentially adversarial environments. STAPincorporates tamper-evident properties, and guarantees eventual detection of compromised nodes that lie or falsely implicate correct nodes. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

However, if SVMs are to be incorporated in real-world security systems, they must be able to cope with attack patterns that can either mislead the learning algorithm (poisoning), evade detection (evasion) or gain information about their internal parameters (privacy breaches). The main contributions of this chapter are twofold. First, we introduce a formal general framework for the empirical evaluation of the security of machine-learning systems. Second, according to our framework, we demonstrate the feasibility of evasion, poisoning and privacy attacks against SVMs in real-world security problems. For each attack technique, we evaluate its impact and discuss whether (and how) it can be countered through an adversary-aware design of SVMs. Our experiments are easily reproducible thanks to open-source code that we have made available, together with all the employed datasets, on a public repository. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

A major requirement on the network is the ability to provide unidentifiability and unlinkability for mobile nodes and their traffic. Although a number of anonymous secure routing protocols have been proposed, the requirement is not fully satisfied. The existing protocols are vulnerable to the attacks of fake routing packets or denial-of-service broadcasting, even the node identities are protected by pseudonyms. In this paper, we propose a new routing protocol, i.e., authenticated anonymous secure routing (AASR), to satisfy the requirement and defend against the attacks. More specifically, the route request packets are authenticated by a group signature, to defend against potential active attacks without unveiling the node identities. The key-encrypted onion routing with a route secret verification message is designed to prevent intermediate nodes from inferring a real destination. Simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed AASR protocol with improved performance as compared with the existing protocols. © 2014 IEEE.",Anonymous routing; authenticated routing; mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs); onion routing,Denial-of-service attack; Network security; Routing protocols; Telecommunication networks; Adversarial environments; Anonymous communication; Anonymous routing; authenticated routing; Mobile adhoc network (MANETs); Onion routing; Route request packets; Secure routing protocols; Mobile ad hoc networks,,,,,"Kelly, D., Raines, R., Baldwin, R., Mullins, B., Grimaila, M., Towards a taxonomy of wired and wireless anonymous networks (2009) Proc.

The network forensics investigation process is complex and processing-intensive such as sifting through network traffic and examining them for evidence, thus it is desirable to approach this task systematically and efficiently with as much structure as is feasible. This paper proposes a model for network forensics analysis that captures appropriately defined adversarial capability and structured by a layered approach to investigation. The former approach eliminates the need to presume on the adversarys behaviour and is independent of specific attack styles, thus is generic; while the latter approach facilitates a more network-intuitive and modular investigation process. We discuss the layered approach and propose the forensics model by defining adversarial capabilities and the experiment setting played between an adversary, a collection of node instances and a forensics analyst. We apply the model in our investigation against samples of traffic captured and show the feasibility of this model on two common network attack instances. Results of evidence collected and conclusions confirm that analysis based on this model is objectively done, and trustworthy evidence successfully gathered and produced. © 2014 IEEE.",adversarial capability; evidence; layers; models; network forensics analysis,Computer crime; Models; adversarial capability; evidence; Evidential networks; Forensics analysis; Forensics investigations; Investigation process; Layered approaches; layers; Digital forensics,,,,,"Acceptable Use Policy of South Tyneside Libraries, , http://www.southtyneside.info/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=7906&p=0, South Tyneside Council Accessed Date 01/10/2013; Bailey, M., Oberheide, J., Andersen, J., Mao, Z.M., Jahanian, F., Nazario, J., Automated classification and analysis of internet malware (2007) LNCS, 4637, pp. 178-197. , Kruegel, C., Lippman, R., Clark, A (eds .)

Indelible marking of the ICs can enable fingerprinting, identification, authentication, metering, and tracing of components along the unascertained semiconductor supply chain. To enable these important objectives, DARPA is soliciting innovative proposals for a SHIELD that enables advanced supply chain hardware authentication capability. The envisioned SHIELD is intended to be a minuscule electronic chip that is physically and inseparably attached to the host electronic component. The desiderata for the SHIELD include providing an ineradicable hardware root-of-trust for cryptographic key storage and encryption, a compact structure encapsulating the keys, a physically-fragile but electrically-robust SHIELD dielet that self-destructs upon adversarial acts, an RF communication and remote charging interface, and sensors for recording the potential attack attempts. We discuss the SHIELD threat model and its potential for addressing a number of standing challenges in this area. We emphasize the dire need for open evaluation and thorough security analysis of SHIELD. © 2014 IEEE.",,Authentication; Cryptography; Supply chains; Timing circuits; Compact structures; Cryptographic key; Electronic chips; Electronic component; Integrated circuits (ICs); Potential attack; Security analysis; Semiconductor supply chain; Integrated circuits,,,,,"Rostami, M., Koushanfar, F., Karri, R., A primer on hardware security: Threat models, metrics, and remedies (2014) Proceedings of the IEEE, pp. 1-13. , to appear; Tehranipoor, M., Koushanfar, F., A survey of hardware trojan taxonomy and detection (2010) IEEE Design & Test of Computers, 27 (1), pp. 10-25; Karri, R., Rajendran, J., Rosenfeld, K., Tehranipoor, M., Trustworthy hardware: Identifying and classifying hardware trojans (2010) IEEE Computer, 43 (10), pp. 39-46; Koushanfar, F., Qu, G., Potkonjak, M., Intellectual property metering (2001) Information Hiding Workshop, pp. 81-95. , 2001; Alkabani, Y., Koushanfar, F., Active hardware metering for intellectual property protection and security (2007) USENIX Security Symposium, pp. 291-306; Roy, J., Koushanfar, F., Markov, I., EPIC: Ending piracy of integrated circuits (2010) IEEE Computer, 43 (10), pp. 30-38; Koushanfar, F., Provably secure active ic metering techniques for piracy avoidance and digital rights management (2012) IEEE Trans. on Information Forensics and Security, 7 (1), pp. 51-63; Sturton, C., Hicks, M., Wagner, D., King, S.T., Defeating uci: Building stealthy and malicious hardware (2011) IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 64-77; Yang, B., Wu, K., Karri, R., Scan based side channel attack on dedicated hardware implementations of data encryption standard (2004) Int.

Currently, algorithms that solve resilient consensus problem demand networks to have high connectivity to overrule the effects of adversaries, or require nodes to have access to some non-local information. In our scheme, we incorporate the notion of trusted nodes to guarantee distributed consensus despite any number of adversarial attacks, even in sparse networks. A subset of nodes, which are more secured against the attacks, constitute a set of trusted nodes. It is shown that the network becomes resilient against any number of attacks whenever the set of trusted nodes form a connected dominating set within the network. We also study a relationship between trusted nodes and the network robustness. Simulations are presented to illustrate and compare our scheme with the existing ones. © 2014 IEEE.",adversary; consensus; dominating set; graph robustness; Resilience,Control engineering; adversary; Connected Dominating Set; consensus; Consensus problems; Consensus protocols; Distributed consensus; Dominating sets; Resilience; Robustness (control systems),,,,,"Olshevsky, A., Tsitsiklis, J.N., Convergence speed in distributed consensus and averaging (2011) SIAM Review, 53 (4), pp. 747-772; Mesbahi, M., Egerstedt, M., (2010) Graph Theoretic Methods in Multiagent Networks, , Princeton University Press; Pease, M., Shostak, R., Lamport, L., Reaching agreement in the presence of faults (1980) Journal of the ACM, 27 (2), pp. 228-234; Lynch, N.A., (1997) Distributed Algorithms, , San Francisco, CA: Morgan Kaufman Publishers Inc; Sundaram, S., Hadjicostis, C., Distributed function calculation via linear iterative strategies in the presence of malicious agents (2011) IEEE Trans.

Just as location-based services grow fast, they lay out many questions and challenges when it comes to privacy. For example, who owns the location data and for what purpose is the data used? To answer these questions, we need new tools for location privacy. In this paper, we focus on the problem of secure location sharing, where a group of n clients want to collaborate with each other to anonymously share their location data with a location database server and execute queries based on them. To become more realistic, we assume up to a certain fraction of the clients are controlled arbitrarily by an active and computationally unbounded adversary. A relaxed version of this problem has already been studied in the literature assuming either a trusted third party or a weaker adversarial model. We alternatively propose a scalable fullydecentralized protocol for secure location sharing that tolerates up to n/6 statically-chosen malicious clients and does not require any trusted third party. We show that, unlike most other location-based services, our protocol is secure against traffic-analysis attacks.

Unfortunately, sharing social-network datasets is often restrained by privacy considerations. One way to address the privacy concern is to anonymize the data before publishing. Randomly adding or deleting edges from the social graph is one of the anonymization approaches that have been proposed in the literature. Recent studies have quantified the level of anonymity that is obtained by random perturbation by means of a posteriori belief probabilities and, by conducting experiments on small datasets, arrived at the conclusion that random perturbation cannot achieve meaningful levels of anonymity without deteriorating the graph properties. We offer a new information-theoretic perspective on the question of anonymizing a social network by means of random edge additions and deletions. We make an essential distinction between image and preimage anonymity and propose a more accurate quantification, based on entropy, of the anonymity level that is provided by the perturbed network. We explain why the entropy-based quantification, which is global, is more adequate than the previously used local quantification that was based on a posteriori belief probabilities. We also prove that the anonymity level as quantified by means of entropy is always greater than or equal to the one based on a posteriori belief probabilities. In addition, we introduce and explore the method of random sparsification, which randomly removes edges, without adding new ones. Extensive experimentation on several very large datasets shows that randomization techniques for identity obfuscation are back in the game, as they may achieve meaningful levels of anonymity while still preserving properties of the original graph. As the methods we study add and remove edges, it is natural to ask whether an adversary might use the disclosed perturbed graph structure to reconstruct, even partially, the original graph. We thus study the resilience of obfuscation by random sparsification to adversarial attacks that are based on link prediction. Given a general link prediction method, with a predefined level of prediction accuracy, we show how to quantify the level of anonymity that is guaranteed by the obfuscation. We empirically prove that even for very accurate link prediction methods, the level of anonymity guaranteed remains very close to the one before the attack. Finally, we show how the randomization method may be applied in a distributed setting, where the network data is distributed among several non-trusting sites, and explain why randomization is far more suitable for such settings than other existing approaches. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Our protocol allows n participants to cast their votes in a way that preserves the privacy of individual values against both internal and external attacks. The protocol is coupled with an extensive theoretical analysis in which we formally prove that our protocol is resistant to collusion against as many as n - 1 corrupted nodes in both the semi-honest and malicious adversarial models. The behavior of our protocol is tested in a real P2P network by measuring its communication delay and processing overhead. The experimental results uncover the advantages of our protocol over previous works in the area; without sacrificing security, our decentralized protocol is shown to be almost one order of magnitude faster than the previous best protocol for providing anonymous feedback. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Some wireless sensor networks preclude the constant presence of a centralized data collection point, that is, a sink. In such a disconnected or unattended setting, nodes must accumulate sensed data until it can be off loaded to an itinerant sink. Furthermore, if the operating environment is hostile, there is a very real danger of node and data compromise. The unattended nature of the network makes it an attractive target for attacks that aim to learn, erase, or modify potentially valuable data collected and held by sensors. We argue that adversarial models and defense techniques in prior WSN literature about security are unsuitable for the unattended WSN setting. We define a new adversarial model by taking into account special features of the UWSN environment. We show that in the presence of a powerful mobile adversary, we focus on intrusion resilience in mobile unattended wireless sensor networks, where sensors move according to some mobility models.

The protocols are executed between a party with access to a physical PUF (prover) and a trusted party who has access to the PUF compact model (verifier). The proposed protocols do not follow the classic paradigm of exposing the full PUF responses or a transformation of them. Instead, random subsets of the PUF response strings are sent to the verifier so the exact position of the subset is obfuscated for the third-party channel observers. Authentication of the responses at the verifier side is done by matching the substring to the available full response string; the index of the matching point is the actual obfuscated secret (or key) and not the response substring itself. We perform a thorough analysis of resiliency of the protocols against various adversarial acts, including machine learning and statistical attacks. The attack analysis guides us in tuning the parameters of the protocol for an efficient and secure implementation. The low overhead and practicality of the protocols are evaluated and confirmed by hardware implementation. © 2014 IEEE.",hardware security; Physical unclonable functions; security protocols,Authentication; Hardware security; Network security; Reverse engineering; Authentication and key exchange; Authentication and key exchange protocols; Hardware implementations; Matching points; Physical unclonable functions (PUF); Secure implementation; Security protocols; Statistical attacks; Cryptography,,,,,"Boyko, V., Mackenzie, P., Patel, S., Provably secure passwordauthenticated key exchange using Diffe-Hellman (2000) Advances in Cryp-tology, pp. 156-171. , New York, NY, USA: Springer-Verlag; Bellare, M., Pointcheval, D., Rogaway, P., Authenticated key exchange secure against dictionary attacks (2000) Proc. 19th Int.

In this paper, we propose a new metric to characterize the criticality of a node in an arbitrary network which we refer to as the Combined Banzhaf & Diversity Index (CBDI). The metric utilizes a diversity index which is based on the variability of a node's attributes relative to its neighbors and the Banzhaf Power Index which characterizes the degree of participation of a node in forming shortest paths. The Banzhaf power index is inspired from the theory of voting games in game theory. We evaluate the performance of the new metric using simulations. Our results indicate that in a number of network topologies, the proposed metric outperforms other proposals which have appeared in the literature. The proposed CBDI index chooses more critical nodes which, when removed, degrade network performance to a greater extent than if critical nodes based on other criticality metrics were removed. © 2014 IEEE.",,Criticality (nuclear fission); Electric network topology; Game theory; Arbitrary networks; Critical node; Diversity index; Human intervention; Network topology; Power indices; Shortest path; Voting game; Network security,,,,,"Shen, Y., Nguyen, N.P., Xuan, Y., Thai, M.T., On the discovery of critical links and nodes for assessing network vulnerability (2012) Networking, IEEE Transactions on, 21 (3), pp. 963-973; Liu, D., Ning, P., Du, W., Detecting malicious beacon nodes for secure location discovery in wireless sensor networks (2005) Distributed Computing Systems, 2005.

We consider a continuum of wireless users facing potential eavesdropping and jamming attacks. For each such attack, we first propose a suitable utility function for the wireless users. Then, we propose a novel optimal placement algorithm for finding the optimal locations of the SCBSs given the underlying security considerations. In eavesdropping scenarios, we consider the prospective eavesdroppers to be spread over a given region. The SCBSs are then placed in such a way to minimize the eavesdroppers' effect without having any information about their exact locations. In jamming scenarios, we consider a cost constrained jammer to be present in the network. The SCBSs are then placed in order to minimize the effect of the jammer's signal on the quality of the user's transmission. We simulate the developed algorithm for both types of attacks and for various network configurations. Simulation results show that the proposed solution approach yields significant improvements in the spatial SINR of all users when compared with conventional placement techniques. © 2014 IEEE.",,Base stations; Heterogeneous networks; Mobile security; Security systems; Signal interference; Spurious signal noise; Heterogeneous wireless network; Network configuration; Optimal deployment; Optimal locations; Optimal placements; Security considerations; Solution approach; Utility functions; Jamming,,,,,"Global mobile data traffic forecast update, 2010-2015 (2011) Cisco White Paper, , Cisco Visual Networking Index; Andrews, J.G., Seven ways that hetnets are a cellular paradigm shift (2013) To Appear, IEEE Communications Magazine; Andrews, J.G., Claussen, H., Dohler, M., Rangan, S., Reed, M.C., Femtocells: Past, present, and future (2012) IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 30 (3), pp. 497-508. , April; Telecoms, I., Media, Small cell market status (2012) SmallCell Forum, Whitepaper, , December; Altman, E., Kumar, A., Singh, C., Sundaresan, R., Spatial SINR games combining base station placement and mobile association (2009) IEEE INFOCOM, , Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Arnold, O., Richter, F., Fettweis, G., Blume, O., Power consumption modeling of different base station types in heterogeneous cellular networks (2010) Future Network and Mobile Summit, 2010, , Florence, Italy; Mo, J., Tao, M., Liu, Y., Relay placement for physical layer security: A secure connection perspective (2012) IEEE Communications Letters, 16; Bhattacharya, S., Basar, T., Optimal strategies to evade jamming in heterogeneous mobile networks (2010) Proceedings of the Workshop on Search and Pursuit-Evasion, , Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Echenique, P., Gomez-Gardenes, J., Moreno, Y., Dynamics of jamming transitions in complex networks (2007) EPL (Europhysics Letters), 71 (2), p. 325; Huang, Y.-M., Hsieh, M.-Y., Chao, H.-C., Hung, S.-H., Park, J.H., Pervasive, secure access to a hierarchical sensor-based healthcare monitoring architecture in wireless heterogeneous networks (2009) IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 27 (4), pp. 400-411; Anderson, R.J., (2010) Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems, , Wiley; Wyner, A., The wire-tap channel (1975) Bell System Technical Journal, 54 (8), pp. 1355-1387; Boyd, S., Vandenberghe, L., (2004) Convex Optimization, , Cambridge University Press; Cortes, J., Martinez, S., Bullo, F., (2004) Spatially-distributed Coverage Optimization and Control with Limited-range Interactions, , arXiv preprint math/0401297; Proakis, J., Manolakis, D., (2007) Digital Signal Processing, , Prentice Hall",,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2014 IEEE Global Communications Conference, GLOBECOM 2014",8 December 2014 through 12 December 2014,,110905,,9.78148E+12,,,English,"IEEE Global Commun.

In this context, many possible IVC applications share the common need for fast multihop message propagation, including information such as position, direction, and speed. However, it is crucial for such a data exchange system to be resilient to security attacks. Conversely, a malicious vehicle might inject incorrect information into the intervehicle wireless links, leading to life and money losses or to any other sort of adversarial selfishness (e.g., traffic redirection for the adversarial benefit). In this paper, we analyze attacks to the state-of-the-art IVC-based safety applications. Furthermore, this analysis leads us to design a fast and secure multihop broadcast algorithm for vehicular communication, which is proved to be resilient to the aforementioned attacks. © 2013 IEEE.",Intervehicular communication (IVC); network security; road vehicle safety; secure multihop broadcasting,,,,,,"Sichitiu, M.L., Kihl, M., Intervehicle communication systems: A survey (2008) IEEE Commun.

This paper considers a pooling problem which models the strategic interaction between an adversary and a sender who chooses relay nodes from a pool of participants, a subset of which is controlled by the adversary. The sender adaptively chooses sets of relay nodes over a number of rounds, while the adversary chooses whether or not to attack in rounds where adversarial nodes are chosen. We introduce a class of strategies, called random pooling strategies, over which it is tractable to optimize and whose performance is within a factor of 1.4 of the optimal strategy when the number of adversaries is given. © 2014 IEEE.",,Computer programming; Networking schemes; Optimal strategies; Pooling problem; Relay node; Strategic interactions; Relay control systems,,,,,"Dingledine, R., Mathewson, N., Syverson, P., Tor: The second-generation onion router (2004) Proceedings of the 13th Conference on USENIX Security Symposium, pp. 21-21; Nambiar, A., Wright, M., Salsa: A structured approach to large-scale anonymity (2006) Proceedings of the 13th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 17-26; McLachlan, J., Tran, A., Hopper, N., Kim, Y., Scalable onion routing with torsk (2009) Proceedings of the 16th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 590-599; Katti, S., Katabi, D., Puchala, K., Slicing the onion: Anonymous routing without PKI (2005) Proceedings of 4th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks (HotNets), , Nov; Fan, Y., Jiang, Y., Zhu, H., Chen, J., Shen, X., Network coding based privacy preservation against traffic analysis in multi-hop wireless networks (2011) IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, 10 (3), pp. 834-843. , March; Gasti, P., Merlo, A., Ciaccio, G., Chiola, G., On the integrity of network coding-based anonymous p2p file sharing networks (2010) Proceedings of 9th IEEE International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications (NCA), pp. 192-197. , July; Wang, J., Wang, J., Wu, C., Lu, K., Gu, N., Anonymous communication with network coding against traffic analysis attack (2011) Proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM'11, pp. 1008-1016. , April; Chang, C., Ho, T., Effros, M., Peer-to-peer anonymous networking using coding (2012) Proceedings of 50th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control and Computing, pp. 525-532. , Oct; Chan, C.L., Jaggi, S., Saligrama, V., Agnihotri, S., (2012) Non-Adaptive Group Testing: Explicit Bounds and Novel Algorithms, , CoRR, abs/1202.0206",,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2014 52nd Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing, Allerton 2014",30 September 2014 through 3 October 2014,,110512,,9.78148E+12,,,English,"Annu.

While much of the existing research has focused on extracting robust and secure content descriptors, a significant open challenge still remains: Most existing video hashing methods are fallible to temporal desynchronization. That is, when the query video results by deleting or inserting some frames from the reference video, most existing methods assume the positions of the deleted (or inserted) frames are either perfectly known or reliably estimated. This assumption may be okay under typical transcoding and frame-rate changes but is highly inappropriate in adversarial scenarios such as anti-piracy video search. For example, an illegal uploader will try to bypass the 'piracy check' mechanism of YouTube/Dailymotion etc by performing a cleverly designed non-uniform resampling of the video. We present a new solution based on dynamic time warping (DTW), which can implement automatic synchronization and can be used together with existing video hashing methods. The second contribution of this paper is to propose a new robust feature extraction method called flow hashing (FH), based on frame averaging and optical flow descriptors. Finally, a fusion mechanism called distance boosting is proposed to combine the information extracted by DTW and FH. Experiments on real video collections show that such a hash extraction and comparison enables unprecedented robustness under both spatial and temporal attacks. © 2014 IEEE.",,Extraction; Feature extraction; Image processing; Optical data processing; Automatic synchronization; Content authentication; Content descriptors; Desynchronization; Fusion mechanism; Hash extraction; Robust feature extractions; Video collections; Crime,,,,,"De Roover, C., De Vleeschouwer, C., Lefebvre, F., Macq, B., Robust video hashing based on radial projections of key frames (2005) Signal Processing, IEEE Transactions on, 53 (10), pp. 4020-4037; Coskun, B., Sankur, B., Memon, N., Spatio temporal transform based video hashing (2006) Multimedia, IEEE Transactions on, 8 (6), pp. 1190-1208; Lee, S., Yoo, C.D., Robust video fingerprinting for content-based video identification (2008) Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, IEEE Transactions on, 18 (7), pp. 983-988; Esmaeili, M.M., Fatourechi, M., Ward, R.K., A robust and fast video copy detection system using contentbased fingerprinting (2011) Information Forensics and Security, IEEE Transactions on, 6 (1), pp. 213-226; Chaudhry, R., Ravichandran, A., Hager, G., Vidal, R., Histograms of oriented optical flow and binet-cauchy kernels on nonlinear dynamical systems for the recognition of human actions (2009) Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009.

Since these problems change over the time, the incremental learning is usually applied in SVMs. However, an intelligent adversary who misleads the learning of SVMs by manipulating the training samples may present in the security problems. As the conventional incremental learning algorithm of SVMs does not consider the adversarial attack, its performance may be affected significantly in the adversarial environment. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerabilities of incremental learning algorithm of SVM under the adversarial attack. The attack model to the incremental learning algorithm of SVM is proposed. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the incremental learning algorithm of SVM reduces dramatically under the proposed attack. © 2014 IEEE.",Adversarial Learning; Causative Attack; Incremental SVM,Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Cybernetics; Learning systems; Support vector machines; Adversarial environments; Adversarial learning; Causative Attack; Incremental learning; Incremental support vector machine; Incremental SVM; Security problems; Training sample; Learning algorithms,,,,,"Nelson, B.A., (2010) Behavior of Machine Learning Algorithms in Adversarial Environments, , tech. rep., DTIC Document; Cauwenberghs, G., Poggio, T., Incremental and decremental support vector machine learning (2001) Advances in Neural Iriformation Processing Systems, pp. 409-415; Syed, N.A., Huan, S., Kah, L., Sung, K., (1999) Incremental Learning with Support Vector Machines; http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/cjlinllibsvmtools/datasets; http://archive.ics.uci.edulml/datasets/Spambase; Lowd, D., Meek, C., (2005) Good Word Attacks on Statistical Spam Filters, , in CEAS; Newsome, J., Karp, B., Song, D., Paragraph: Thwarting signature learning by training maliciously (2006) Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection, pp. 81-105. , Springer; Mukkamala, S., Janoski, G., Sung, A., Intrusion detection using neural networks and support vector machines (2002) Neural Networks 2002.

Sadly, this aspect is missing from current cybersecurity classes, which are often taught through lectures and occasionally through “get your feet wet” practical exercises. We propose Class Capture-the-Flag exercises (CCTFs) to revitalize cybersecurity education. These are small-scoped competitions that pit teams of students against each other in realistic attack-defense scenarios. We describe how to design these exercises to be easy for teachers to conduct and grade, easy for students to prepare for and a lot of fun for everyone involved. We also provide descriptions of CCTFs we have developed and recount our experiences of using them in class. © 2014 USENIX Summit on Gaming, Games, and Gamification in Security Education, 3GSE 2014.

ROP attacks require no code injection, and have already been shown to be powerful enough to bypass fine-grained memory randomization (ASLR) defenses. To counter this ingenious attack strategy, several proposals for enforcement of (coarse-grained) control-flow integrity (CFI) have emerged. The key argument put forth by these works is that coarse-grained CFI policies are sufficient to prevent ROP attacks. As this reasoning has gained traction, ideas put forth in these proposals have even been incorporated into coarse-grained CFI defenses in widely adopted tools (e.g., Microsoft's EMET framework). In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive security analysis of various CFI solutions (covering kBouncer, ROPecker, CFI for COTS binaries, ROP-Guard, and Microsoft EMET 4.1). A key contribution is in demonstrating that these techniques can be effectively undermined, even under weak adversarial assumptions. More specifically, we show that with bare minimum assumptions, turing-complete and real-world ROP attacks can still be launched even when the strictest of enforcement policies is in use.

However, to the best of our knowledge, the robustness of MCSs for non-linear classifiers has not been inves-tigated. This paper attempts to discuss two issues experimentally including a MCS is still more robust than a single classifier for non-linear classifiers, and also a non-linear classifier is more robust than a linear classifier. Besides the accuracy, we adopt the hardness of evasion as the evaluation criterion to measure the robustness of a classifier. The results show that MCSs and non-linear classifiers are more robust to the evasion attack generally. © 2014 IEEE.",Adversarial Learning; Evasion Attacks; Hardness of Evasion; Robustness Measure,Pattern recognition; Wavelet analysis; Adversarial learning; Evaluation criteria; Evasion Attacks; Linear classifiers; Multiple classifier systems; Nonlinear classifiers; Robustness measures; Hardness,,,,,"Dalvi, N., Domingos, P., Mausam, Sanghai, S., Verma, D., Adversarial classification (2004) Tenth ACM SIGKDD International Conference On Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), pp. 99-108. , Seattle; Huang, L., Joseph, A.D., Nelson, B., Rubinstein, B., Tygar, J.D., Adversarial machine learning (2011) 4th ACM Workshop On Artificial Intelligence and Security (AISec 2011), pp. 43-57. , Chicago, IL, USA, October; Biggio, B., Fumera, G., Roli, F., Security evaluation of pattern classifiers under attack (2013) IEEE Transactions On Knowledge and Data Engineering, 99 (1). , PrePrints; Lowd, D., Meek, C., Good word attacks on statistical spam filters (2005) Second Conference On Email and Anti-Spam (CEAS), , Mountain View, CA, USA; Globerson, A., Roweis, S.T., Nightmare at test time: Robust learning by feature deletion (2006) Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference On Machine Learning, 148, pp. 353-360. , William W.

To ensure the security of the system, face liveness detection is carried out to distinguish the images captured from a live face from those from a forged face. In this paper, we propose a face liveness detection method based on the High Frequency Descriptor to combat the spoofing attack. The additional illumination is added, which can raise the energy of high frequency components of a real face by exposing more details of the hair and skin, and lower it by causing a glisten on the planar surface. The difference of the energy of high frequency components between images with and without the illumination is calculated. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the original method and has robustness when the resolution of the attack media is high. © 2014 IEEE.",Anti-spoofing; Biometrics identification; Face liveness detection; Face recognition; Fourier spectrum,Authentication; Pattern recognition; Wavelet analysis; Anti-spoofing; Face liveness; Fourier spectra; High frequency components; High frequency HF; Planar surface; Spoofing attacks; Video clips; Face recognition,,,,,"Tan, X., Li, Y., Liu, J., Jiang, L., Face liveness detection from a single image with sparse low rank bilinear discriminative model (2010) Computer Vision-ECCV 2010, pp. 504-517. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg; Zhang, Z., Yi, D., Lei, Z., Li, S.Z., Face liveness detection by learning multispectral reflectance distributions (2011) Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition and Workshops (FG 2011), 2011 IEEE International Conference On, pp. 436-441. , IEEE; Jee, H.-K., Jung, S.-U., Yoo, J.-H., Liveness detection for embedded face recognition system (2006) International Journal of Biomedical Sciences, 1 (4), pp. 235-238; Kollreider, K., Fronthaler, H., Bigun, J., Non-intrusive liveness detection by face images (2009) Image and Vision Computing, 27 (3), pp. 233-244; Pan, G., Wu, Z., Sun, L., Liveness detection for face recognition (2008) Recent Advances in Face Recognition, pp. 109-124; Pan, G., Sun, L., Wu, Z., Wang, Y., Monocular camera-based face liveness detection by combining eyeblink and scene context (2011) Telecommunication Systems, 47 (3-4), pp. 215-225; Bao, W., Li, H., Li, N., Jiang, W., A liveness detection method for face recognition based on optical flow field (2009) Image Analysis and Signal Processing, 2009.

However, ML models are typically derived from fixed datasets, and must be periodically retrained. In adversarial environments, attackers can adapt by modifying their behavior or even sabotaging ML models by polluting training data. In this paper1, we perform an empirical study of adversarial attacks against machine learning models in the context of detecting malicious crowdsourcing systems, where sites connect paying users with workers willing to carry out malicious campaigns. By using human workers, these systems can easily circumvent deployed security mechanisms, e.g. CAPTCHAs. We collect a dataset of malicious workers actively performing tasks on Weibo, China's Twitter, and use it to develop ML-based detectors. We show that traditional ML techniques are accurate (95%-99%) in detection but can be highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, including simple evasion attacks (workers modify their behavior) and powerful poisoning attacks (where administrators tamper with the training set). We quantify the robustness of ML classifiers by evaluating them in a range of practical adversarial models using ground truth data. Our analysis provides a detailed look at practical adversarial attacks on ML models, and helps defenders make informed decisions in the design and configuration of ML detectors. copyright © 2014 USENIX Security Symposium.All right reserved.",,Machine learning; Network security; Social networking (online); Adversarial environments; Empirical studies; Ground truth data; Informed decision; Machine learning models; Poisoning attacks; Security mechanism; Training data; Crowdsourcing,,,,,"(2014) Sina Weibo Admin Statement on Spam, , http://www.weibo.com/p/1001603697836242954625, April; (2014) Sina Weibo Terms of Service, , http://service.account.weibo.com/roles/guiding, The link is accessible after login; Ahn, Y.-Y., Han, S., Kwak, H., Moon, S., Jeong, H., Analysis of topological characteristics of huge online social networking services (2007) Proc.

As this adversarial scenario is not taken into account by classical design methods, pattern classification systems may exhibit vulnerabilities, whose exploitation may severely affect their performance, and consequently limit their practical utility. Extending pattern classification theory and design methods to adversarial settings is thus a novel and very relevant research direction, which has not yet been pursued in a systematic way. In this paper, we address one of the main open issues: evaluating at design phase the security of pattern classifiers, namely, the performance degradation under potential attacks they may incur during operation. We propose a framework for empirical evaluation of classifier security that formalizes and generalizes the main ideas proposed in the literature, and give examples of its use in three real applications. Reported results show that security evaluation can provide a more complete understanding of the classifier's behavior in adversarial environments, and lead to better design choices. © 1989-2012 IEEE.",Adversarial classification; Pattern classification; Performance evaluation; Robustness evaluation; Security evaluation,Biometrics; Intrusion detection; Pattern recognition; Pattern recognition systems; Adversarial classifications; Adversarial environments; Biometric authentication; Network intrusion detection; Performance degradation; Performance evaluation; Robustness evaluation; Security evaluation; Design,,,,,"Rodrigues, R.N., Ling, L.L., Govindaraju, V., Robustness of multimodal biometric fusion methods against spoof attacks (2009) J.

We first review previous work and report examples of how a complex system may be evaded either by leveraging on trivial vulnerabilities of its untrained components, e.g. parsing errors in the pre-processing steps, or by exploiting more subtle vulnerabilities of learning algorithms. We then discuss the need of exploiting both reactive and proactive security paradigms complementarily to improve the security by design. Our ultimate goal is to provide some useful guidelines for improving the security of pattern recognition in adversarial settings, and to suggest related open issues to foster research in this area. ©World Scientific Publishing Company.",Adversarial learning; Robust classification; Secure pattern recognition,Learning algorithms; Malware; Pattern recognition; Adversarial learning; Malware detection; Potential attack; Pre-processing step; Proactive security; Research challenges; Robust classification; Sensitive application; Pattern recognition systems,,,,,"Adler, A., Vulnerabilities in biometric encryption systems (2005) 5th Int.

First we study dynamic (multi-stage) weight selection optimal control for consensus protocols. For the general (multi-stage) case, the solution exists but can rarely be expressed in closed-form. In view of this, we apply optimization techniques to obtain a locally (and possibly globally) optimizing feasible control path. For the one-stage case, however, we obtain a closed-form solution for the optimal control and provide sufficient conditions for the existence of a control that makes the system reach consensus in only one iteration. We then consider a game theoretical model for the problem of a network with an adversary corrupting the control signal with noise. We derive the optimal strategies for both players (the adversary and the network designer) of the resulting game using a saddle point equilibrium (SPE) solution in mixed strategies. © 2014 IEEE.",,,,,,,"Fax, J., Murray, R., Information flow and cooperative control of vehicle formations (2004) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 49 (9), pp. 1465-1476; Cybenko, G., Dynamic load balancing for distributed memory multiprocessors (1989) Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, 7 (2), pp. 279-301. , Oct; Vukovic, O., Dan, G., Security of fully distributed power system state estimation: Detection and mitigation of data integrity attacks (2014) IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 32 (7), pp. 1500-1508. , July; Avrachenkov, K., El Chamie, M., Neglia, G., A local average consensus algorithm for wireless sensor networks (2011) Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems and Workshops (DCOSS), pp. 1-6. , June; Ren, W., Beard, R., Consensus seeking in multiagent systems under dynamically changing interaction topologies (2005) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 50 (5), pp. 655-661. , May; Nedic, A., Olshevsky, A., Ozdaglar, A., Tsitsiklis, J.N., On distributed averaging algorithms and quantization effects (2009) IEEE Trans. on Automatic Control, 54 (11), pp. 2506-2517. , Nov; El Chamie, M., Liu, J., Başar, T., Design and analysis of distributed averaging with quantized communication (2014) Proceedings of the 53rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control CDC 2014, p. 6. , (Los Angeles, California, Dec. 15-17), December; Olfati-Saber, R., Murray, R., Consensus problems in networks of agents with switching topology and time-delays (2004) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 49 (9), pp. 1520-1533. , Sept; Khanafer, A., Touri, B., Başar, T., Robust distributed averaging on networks with adversarial intervention (2013) Proceedings of the 52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control CDC 2013 (Florence, Italy, Dec. 10-13), , December; Xiao, L., Boyd, S., Fast linear iterations for distributed averaging (2004) Systems and Control Letters, 53, pp. 65-78; El Chamie, M., Neglia, G., Avrachenkov, K., Distributed weight selection in consensus protocols by schatten norm minimization (2012) INRIA, , http://hal.inria.fr/hal-00738249, INRIA Research Report RR-8078, Oct accepted to IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control as Technical Note.

A growing number of adversarial data mining techniques are recently developed, providing robust solutions under specific defense-attack models. Existing techniques are tied to distributional assumptions geared towards minimizing the undesirable impact of given attack models. However, the large variety of attack strategies renders the adversarial learning problem multimodal. Therefore, it calls for a more flexible modeling ideology for equivocal input. In this paper we present a Bayesian hierarchical mixtures of experts for adversarial learning. The technique groups data into soft partitions and fits simple function approximators, referred to as ""experts"", within each. Experts are ranked using gating functions for each input. Ambiguous input is predicted competitively by multiple experts, while unambiguous input is effectively predicted by a single expert. Optimal attacks minimizing the likelihood of malicious data are modeled interactively at both expert and gating levels in the learning hierarchy. We demonstrate that our adversarial hierarchicalmixtures-of-experts learning model is robust against adversarial attacks on both artificial and real data.

Over the last several years, human-centered cyber research has provided valuable insights into the cognitive and collaborative work within cyber operations, but has largely ignored how the genesis, intentions, methods and outcomes of cyber attacks impact human-related outcomes. Leveraging insights from other, more technologically focused communities, the goal of this paper is to synthesize previous work and to present a unified, descriptive framework of cyber attacks. Our framework, which consists of three dimensions, adversarial, methodological, and operational, aims to maintain the rich interactions between the components of a cyber attack while offering a further abstraction useful to future human factors research. We present each dimension in terms of the previous techno-centered research, demonstrate how the human factors community can contribute to our understanding, and ground each within the context of the StuxNet virus.",,Crime; Ergonomics; Human engineering; Viruses; Collaborative Work; Cyber operations; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Human factors research; Stuxnet; Three dimensions; Computer crime,,,,,"Bahr, G.S., Ford, R.A., How and why pop-ups don't work: Pop-up prompted eye movements, user affect and decision making (2011) Computers in Human Behavior, 27 (2), pp. 776-783; Ballora, M., Giacobe, N.A., McNeese, M., Hall, D.L., Information data fusion and computer network defense (2012) Situational Awareness in Computer Network Defense: Principles, Methods and Applications, pp. 141-164. , C.

Resulting alerts are reviewed by the organization's cyber security personnel to investigate and assess the threat and initiate appropriate actions to defend the organization's network assets. While automated software routines are essential to cope with the massive volumes of data transmitted across data networks, the ultimate success of an organization's efforts to resist adversarial attacks upon their cyber assets relies on the effectiveness of individuals and teams. This paper reports research to understand the factors that impact the effectiveness of Cyber Security Incidence Response Teams (CSIRTs). Specifically, a simulation is described that captures the workflow within a CSIRT. The simulation is then demonstrated in a study comparing the differential response time to threats that vary with respect to key characteristics (attack trajectory, targeted asset and perpetrator). It is shown that the results of the simulation correlate with data from the actual incident response times of a professional CSIRT.",,Computer crime; Ergonomics; Human engineering; Intrusion detection; Cyber security; Differential response; Incident response; Intrusion Detection Systems; Key characteristics; Large organizations; Network activities; Network assets; Network security,,,,,"Chi, S.D., Park, J.S., Jung, K.C., Lee, J.S., Network security modeling and cyber attack simulation methodology (2001) Information Security and Privacy Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2119, pp. 320-333; Coviello, A.W., Open letter to RSA customers (2011) RSA, , [database online]; Dutt, V., Ahn, Y.S., Gonzalez, C., Cyber situation awareness modeling detection of cyber attacks with instance-based learning theory (2013) Human Factors, 55 (3), pp. 605-618; Eom, J.H., Han, Y.J., Park, S.H., Chung, T.M., Active cyber attack model for network system's vulnerability assessment (2008) Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Science and Security, pp. 153-158. , Seoul Korea; Finkle, J., Hosenball, M., Exclusive: More U.S. Retailers victims of cyber attacks - Sources (2014) Reuters, , Sun January 12th; Futoransky, A., Miranda, F., Orlicki, J., Sarraute, C., Simulating cyber attacks for fun and profit (2009) Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Simulation Tools and Techniques; Hamilton, S.N., Hamilton, W.L., Adversary modeling and simulation in cyber warfare (2008) Proceedings of the 23rd International Information Security Conference, 278, pp. 461-475; Klein, G., Calderwood, R., Clinton-Cirocco, A., Rapid decision making on the fire ground: The original study plus a postscript (2010) Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making, 4 (3), pp. 186-209; Kotenko, I., Agent-based modeling and simulation of cyber warfare between malefactors and security agents in internet (2005) Proceedings of the 19th European Conference on Modeling and Simulation; Kotenko, I., Konovalov, A., Shorov, A., Agent-based modeling and simulation of botnets and botnet defense (2010) Proceedings of the Conference on Cyber Conflict, pp. 21-44. , Tallinn Estonia; Kuhl, M.E., Kistner, J., Costantini, K., Sudit, M., Cyber attack modeling and simulation for network security analysis (2001) WSC '07 Proceedings of the 39th Conference on Winter Simulation, pp. 1180-1188. , IEEE Press: Piscataway NJ; LeBlanc, S.P., Partington, A., Chapman, I., Bernier, M., An overview of cyber attack and computer network operations simulation (2011) Proceedings of the 2011 Military Modleing and Simulation Symposium, pp. 92-100; Lee, J.K., Lee, M.W., Lee, J.S., Chi, S.D., Ohn, S.Y., Automated cyber attack scenario generation using the symbolic simulation (2005) Artificial Intelligence and Simulation Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3397, pp. 380-389; Mateski, M., Trevino, C.M., Veitch, C.K., Michalski, J., Harris, J.M., Maruoka, S., Frye, J., (2012) Cyber Threat Metrics, , Sandia National Laboratories; Shen, D., Chen, G., Haynes, L., Blasch, E., Strategies comparison for game theoretic cyber situational awareness and impact assessment (2007) Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Information Fusion, pp. 1-8. , Quebec, Quebec; Shiva, S., Roy, S., Bedi, H., Dasgupta, D., Wu, Q., A stochastic game model with imperfect information in cyber security (2010) Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on InformationWarfare and Security; Van Leeuwen, B., Urias, V., Eldridge, J., Villamarin, C., Olsberg, R., Cyber security analysis testbed: Combining real, emulation and simulation (2010) Proceedings of the IEEE Carnahan Conference on Security Technology, pp. 121-126. , San Jose CA; Yun, J.B., Park, E.K., Im, E.G., In, H.P., A scalable, ordered scenario-based network security simulator (2005) Systems Modeling and Simulation: Theories and Applications Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3398, pp. 487-494; Zakrzewska, A.N., Ferragut, E.M., Modeling of cyber conflicts using an extended Petri Net formalism (2011) Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Cyber Security, pp. 60-67. , Paris; Zetter, K., Google hack attack was ultra sophisticated, new details show (2010) Wired Magazine, 14",,,,Human Factors an Ergonomics Society Inc.,"58th International Annual Meeting of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, HFES 2014",27 October 2014 through 31 October 2014,,112852,10711813,9.78095E+12,PHFSD,,English,Proc Hum Factors Ergon Soc,Conference Paper,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957697701

The core challenge in this class of applications is that adversaries are not static data generators, but make a deliberate effort to evade the classifiers deployed to detect them. We investigate both the problem of modeling the objectives of such adversaries, as well as the algorithmic problem of accounting for rational, objective-driven adversaries. In particular, we demonstrate severe shortcomings of feature reduction in adversarial settings using several natural adversarial objective functions, an observation that is particularly pronounced when the adversary is able to substitute across similar features (for example, replace words with synonyms or replace letters in words). We offer a simple heuristic method for making learning more robust to feature cross-substitution attacks. We then present a more general approach based on mixed-integer linear programming with constraint generation, which implicitly trades off overfitting and feature selection in an adversarial setting using a sparse regularizer along with an evasion model. Our approach is the first method for combining an adversarial classification algorithm with a very general class of models of adversarial classifier evasion. We show that our algorithmic approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives.",,Artificial intelligence; Heuristic methods; Information science; Integer programming; Learning systems; Malware; Adversarial classifications; Algorithmic approach; Algorithmic problems; Constraint generation; Malware detection; Mixed integer linear programming; Objective functions; Substitution attack; Algorithms,,,,,"Fawcett, T., Provost, F., Adaptive fraud detection (1997) Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 1 (3), pp. 291-316; Mahoney, M.V., Chan, P.K., Learning nonstationary models of normal network traffic for detecting novel attacks (2002) Proceedings of the Eighth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 376-385. , ACM; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., The security of machine learning (2010) Machine Learning, 81 (2), pp. 121-148; Barreno, M., Bartlett, P.L., Chi, F.J., Joseph, A.D., Nelson, B., Rubinstein, B.I.P., Saini, U., Doug Tygar, J., Open problems in the security of learning (2008) Proceedings of the 1st ACM Workshop on Workshop on AISec, pp. 19-26. , ACM; Biggio, B., Fumera, G., Roli, F., Security evaluation of pattern classifiers under attack (2013) IEEE Transactions on Data and Knowledge Engineering, 26 (4), pp. 984-996; Laskov, P., Lippmann, R., Machine learning in adversarial environments (2010) Machine Learning, 81 (2), pp. 115-119; Nelson, B., Rubinstein, B.I.P., Huang, L., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., Classifier evasion: Models and open problems (2011) Privacy and Security Issues in Data Mining and Machine Learning, pp. 92-98. , Springer; Lowd, D., Meek, C., Adversarial learning (2005) Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery in Data Mining, pp. 641-647. , ACM; Karlberger, C., Bayler, G., Kruegel, C., Kirda, E., Exploiting redundancy in natural language to penetrate Bayesian spam filters (2007) WOOT, 7, pp. 1-7; Sahami, M., Dumais, S., Heckerman, D., Horvitz, E., A Bayesian approach to filtering junk e-mail (1998) Learning for Text Categorization: Papers from the 1998 Workshop, 62, pp. 98-105; Kong, Y., Zhao, J., Learning to filter unsolicited commercial e-mail (2012) International Proceedings of Computer Science & Information Technology, 49; Metsis, V., Androutsopoulos, I., Paliouras, G., Spam filtering with naive bayes-which naive bayes?

As the adversarial models in CL-PKC are relatively complex, designing efficient and secure certificateless encryption schemes in the standard model has been an interesting and challenging research topic. In this paper, we give cryptanalysis to an existing certificateless encryption scheme in the standard model. We show its insecurity by demonstrating two kinds of attacks. Then, we modify the original scheme to obtain a secure one. A rigorous security proof of the modified scheme is presented in the standard model based on the decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption and decisional truncated q-ABDHE assumption.

Syntactic privacy definitions have been under the cursor of the research community for the past many years. A lot of research is primarily dedicated to developing algorithms and notions for syntactic privacy that thwart the re-identification attacks. Sweeney and Samarati proposed a well-known syntactic privacy definition coined K-anonymity for thwarting linking attacks using quasi-identifiers. Thanks to its conceptual simplicity, K-anonymity has been widely implemented as a practicable definition of syntactic privacy, and owing to algorithmic advancement for K-anonymous versions of micro-data, K-anonymity has attained much anticipated popularity. Semantic privacy definitions do not take into account the adversarial background knowledge but rather forces the sanitization algorithms (mechanisms) to satisfy a strong semantic property by the way of random processes. Though semantic privacy definitions are theoretically immune to any kind of adversarial attacks, their applicability in real-life scenarios has come under criticism. In order to make the semantic definitions more practical, the research community has focused its attention towards combining the practicalness of syntactic privacy with the strength of semantic approaches [7] such that we may in the near future benefit from both research tracks. © 2014 IEEE.",Data Privacy; Differential Privacy; K-anonymity; Semantic Privacy; Syntactic Privacy,Random processes; Semantics; Syntactics; Back-ground knowledge; Conceptual simplicity; Differential privacies; K-Anonymity; Privacy-preserving data publications; Re identifications; Research communities; Semantic properties; Data privacy,,,,,"Anjum, A., Raschia, G., Spatial indexing combined with clustering for privacy-preserving data publishing (2011) Actes des JournÃ©es Bases de DonnÃ©es AvancÃ©es (BDA'2011), , Rabat, Morocco; Cormode, G., Personal privacy vs population privacy: Learning to attack anonymization (2011) Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, KDD '11, pp. 1253-1261. , New York, NY, USA.

Example applications include classifications for detecting spam email, network intrusion detection and credit card scoring. In fact as the gamut of application domains of machine learning grows, the possibility and opportunity for adversarial behavior will only increase. Till now, the standard assumption about modeling adversarial behavior has been to empower an adversary to change all features of the classifier sat will. The adversary pays a cost proportional to the size of 'attack'. We refer to this form of adversarial behavior as a dense feature attack. However, the aim of an adversary is not just to subvert a classifier but carry out data transformation in a way such that spam continues to appear like spam to the user as much as possible. We demonstrate that an adversary achieves this objective by carrying out a sparse feature attack. We design an algorithm to show how a classifier should be designed to be robust against sparse adversarial attacks. Our main insight is that sparse feature attacks are best defended by designing classifiers which use l1 regularizers. © 2014 IEEE.",Adversarial learning; l1 regularizer; Sparse modelling,Data mining; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Metadata; Adversarial learning; Credit cards; Data transformation; Machine learning techniques; Network intrusion detection; Regularizer; Sparse features; Standard assumptions; Classification (of information),,,,,"Dalvi, N., Domingos, P., Sanghai, M.S., Verma, D., Adversarial classification (2004) KDD '04: Proceedings of the Tenth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 99-108. , New York, NY, USA: ACM; Lowd, D., Meek, C., Adversarial learning (2005) KDD '05: Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM SIGKDD International Confer Ence on Knowledge Discovery in Data Mining, pp. 641-647. , New York, NY, USA: ACM; Globerson, A., Roweis, S., Nightmare at test time: Robust learning by feature deletion (2006) Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 353-360. , New York, NY, USA: ACM; Liu, W., Chawla, S., Mining adversarial patterns via regularized loss minimizati on (2010) Machine Learning, 81 (1), pp. 69-83; Brückner, M., Scheffer, T., Stackelberg games for adversarial prediction problems (2011) Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining.

Online popularity of a user or product (via follows, page-likes, etc.) can be monetized on the premise of higher ad click-through rates or increased sales. Web services and social networks which incentivize popularity thus suffer from a major problem of fake connections from link fraudsters looking to make a quick buck. Typical methods of catching this suspicious behavior use spectral techniques to spot large groups of often blatantly fraudulent (but sometimes honest) users. However, small-scale, stealthy attacks may go unnoticed due to the nature of low-rank Eigen analysis used in practice. In this work, we take an adversarial approach to find and prove claims about the weaknesses of modern, state-of-the-art spectral methods and propose fBox, an algorithm designed to catch small-scale, stealth attacks that slip below the radar. Our algorithm has the following desirable properties: (a) it has theoretical underpinnings, (b) it is shown to be highly effective on real data and (c) it is scalable (linear on the input size). We evaluate fBox on a large, public 41.7 million node, 1.5 billion edge who-follows-whom social graph from Twitter in 2010 and with high precision identify many suspicious accounts which have persisted without suspension even to this day. © 2014 IEEE.",link fraud; social networks,Social networking (online); Web services; Click-through rate; High-precision; link fraud; On-line network; Spectral methods; Spectral techniques; State of the art; Stealth attacks; Data mining,,,,,"Akoglu, L., McGlohon, M., Faloutsos, C., Oddball: Spotting anomalies in weighted graphs (2010) Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 410-421; Beutel, A., Xu, W., Guruswami, V., Palow, C., Faloutsos, C., Copycatch: Stopping group attacks by spotting lockstep behavior in social networks (2013) WWW, pp. 119-130. , ACM; Dalvi, N., Domingos, P., Sanghai, S., Verma, D., Adversarial classification (2004) SIGKDD, pp. 99-108. , ACM; Erdos, P., Rényi, A., On random graphs (1959) Publicationes Mathematicae Debrecen, 6, pp. 290-297; Ghosh, S., Viswanath, B., Kooti, F., Sharma, N.K., Korlam, G., Benevenuto, F., Ganguly, N., Gummadi, K.P., Understanding and combating link farming in the twitter social network (2012) WWW, pp. 61-70. , ACM; Grier, C., Thomas, K., Paxson, V., Zhang, M., At spam: The underground on 140 characters or less (2010) CCS, , ACM; Jiang, M., Cui, P., Beutel, A., Faloutsos, C., Yang, S., Inferring strange behavior from connectivity pattern in social networks (2014) PAKDD; Kwak, H., Lee, C., Park, H., Moon, S., What is Twitter, a social network or a news media?

Typically, security is achieved by relying on an existing credential infrastructure, such as a PKI or passwords, for identifying the end points to each other. But what can be obtained when no such credential infrastructure is available? Clearly, when there is no pre-existing credential infrastructure, an adversary can mount successful “man in the middle” (MIM) attacks by modifying the communication between the legitimate endpoints. Still, we show that not all is lost, as long as the adversary’s control over the communication is not complete: We present relatively efficient key exchange and secure session protocols that guarantee that any MIM adversary is immediately detected as soon as he fails to intercept even a single message between the legitimate endpoints. To obtain this guarantee we strengthen the notion of key exchange to require that the keys exchanged in any two sessions are independent of each other as long as each session has at least one honest endpoint, even if both sessions has an adversarial endpoint. We call this notion credential-free key exchange. We then strengthen the existing notion of secure session protocols to provide the above guarantee given a CFKE (existing definitions and constructions are insufficient for this purpose). We provide two alternative definitions and constructions of CFKE, a game-based one with a (very efficient) construction in the RO model, and a UC one with a construction in the CRS model. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",,Chromium compounds; Cryptography; Cryptographic primitives; End points; Game-Based; Key exchange; Man in the middle; RO modeling; Secure key exchanges; Secure session; Network security,,,,,"Arkko, J., Lehtovirta, V., Eronen, P., RFC 5448: Improved extensible authentication protocol method for 3rd generation authentication and key agreement (2009) EAPAKA’, , http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5448, May; Barak, B., Constant-round coin-tossing with a man in the middle or realizing the shared random string model (2002) FOCS, pp. 345-355. , IEEE Computer Society; Barak, B., Canetti, R., Lindell, Y., Pass, R., Rabin, T., Secure ComputationWithout Authentication (2005) CRYPTO 2005.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such metric proposed to ensure a fairer comparison of cryptographic designs. We then apply this new metric to meaningful use cases by studying Substitution-Permutation Network permutations that are suited for hardware implementations, and we provide new results on hardware-friendly cryptographic building blocks. For practical reasons, we considered linear and differential attacks and we restricted ourselves to fully serial and round-based implementations. We explore several design strategies, from the geometry of the internal state to the size of the S-box, the field size of the diffusion layer or even the irreducible polynomial defining the finite field. We finally test all possible strategies to provide designers an exhaustive approach in building hardware-friendly cryptographic primitives (according to area or FOAM metrics), also introducing a model for predicting the hardware performance of round-based or serial-based implementations. In particular, we exhibit new diffusion matrices (circulant or serial) that are surprisingly more efficient than the current best known, such as the ones used in AES, LED and PHOTON. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2014.",Diffusion matrices; Figure of adversarial merit; Lightweight cryptography; SPN,Cryptography; Diffusion; Structural optimization; Chromium compounds; Embedded systems; Cryptographic primitives; Diffusion matrices; Figure of adversarial merit; Hardware implementations; Hardware performance; Irreducible polynomials; Light-weight cryptography; Substitution permutation network; Hardware security,,,,,"Avoine, G., Oechslin, P., A Scalable and Provably Secure Hash-Based RFID Protocol (2005) Percom Workshops, pp. 110-114. , IEEE Computer Society; Badel, S., Dagtekin, N., Nakahara, J., Ouafi, K., Reffe, N., Sepehrdad, P., Susil, P., Vaudenay, S., ARMADILLO: A Multi-purpose Cryptographic Primitive Dedicated to Hardware (2010) CHES 2010.

They are governed by slow deliberative processes involving testing, security patch deployment, and humanin-the-loop monitoring. As a result, adversaries can systematically probe target networks, pre-plan their attacks, and ultimately persist for long times inside compromised networks and hosts. A new class of technologies, called Adaptive Cyber Defense (ACD), is being developed that presents adversaries with optimally changing attack surfaces and system configurations, forcing adversaries to continually re-assess and re-plan their cyber operations. Although these approaches (e.g., moving target defense, dynamic diversity, and bio-inspired defense) are promising, they assume stationary and stochastic, but nonadversarial, environments. To realize the full potential, we need to build the scientific foundations so that system resiliency and robustness in adversarial settings can be rigorously defined, quantified, measured, and extrapolated in a rigorous and reliable manner. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",,Biomimetics; Information systems; Information use; Stochastic systems; Cyber operations; Deliberative process; Human-in-the-loop; Moving target defense; Scientific foundations; Security patches; System configurations; Uncertain reasoning; Network security,,,,,"Jajodia, S., Ghosh, A.K., Swarup, V., Wang, C., Wang, X.S., (2011) Moving Target Defense: Creating Asymmetric Uncertainty for Cyber Threats, Berlin, 54, 183p. , Springer Advances in Information Security, ISBN 978-1-4614-0976-2; Jajodia, S., Ghosh, A.K., Subrahmanian, V.S., Swarup, V., Wang, C., Wang, X.S., (2013) Moving Target Defense II: Application of Game Theory and Adversarial Modeling, Berlin, 100, 203p. , Springer Advances in Information Security, ISBN 978-1-4614-5415-1; Birman, K.P., Schneider, F.B., The monoculture risk put into context (2009) IEEE Security & Privacy, 7 (1), pp. 14-17; Forrest, S., Somayaji, A., Ackley, D.H., Building diverse computer systems (1997) Proc. 6Th Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems, pp. 67-72; Meisel, M., Pappas, V., Zhang, L., A taxonomy of biologically inspired research in computer networking (2010) Computer Networks, 54 (6), pp. 901-916; Albanese, M., Battista, E., Jajodia, S., Casola, V., Manipulating the attacker's view of a system's attack surface (2014) 2014 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security, CNS 2014, pp. 472-480. , San Francisco, California, USA, October; Wang, L., Zhang, M., Jajodia, S., Singhal, A., Albanese, M., Modeling Network Diversity for Evaluating the Robustness of Networks against Zero-Day Attacks (2014) ICAIS 2014, Part II.

It saves the cost and time on sample labeling. Recently, semi-supervised learning has been applied in many security applications. An adversary may present in these applications to confuse the learning processes. In this paper, we investigate the influence of the adversarial attack on the semi-supervised learning. We propose a causative attack, which injects the attack samples in the training set, to mislead the training of the semi-supervised learning.

One of the countermeasures is called the data sanitization which removes suspect attack or noisy samples before training. The data sanitization can be categorized into classifier-independent and classifier-dependent methods. Classifier-independent methods measure the characteristics of the samples while classifiers are trained in classifier-dependent methods. Although the accuracy of classifier-dependent methods is higher, they are time-consumed in comparison with classifier-independent methods. This paper proposes a data sanitization method using both classifier-dependent and classifier-independent information. Not only one sample but a set of similar samples identified by the relative neighborhood graph are considered in Reject on Negative Impact method. The experimental results suggest that the performance of the proposed method is similar to the RONI but with less time complexity. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.",Adversarial classification; Data sanitization; RONI,Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Adversarial classifications; Adversarial learning; Relative Neighborhood graphs; RONI; Sanitization; Time complexity; Training sample; Classification (of information),,,,,"Zhou, Y., Jorgensen, Z., Inge, M., Combating good word attacks on statistical spam filters with multiple instance learning.

Previous work has focused on determining the optimal patrol algorithm when facing a general adversary that tries to penetrate once through the patrol path. There, the robots' goal is to detect penetrations, i.e., the robots do not change their behavior once a penetration is detected. Requiring the robots to physically inspect penetration attempts can have far reaching consequences on the performance of the patrol algorithm. Specifically, it creates vulnerability points along the patrol path that a knowledgeable adversary can take advantage of. In this work we investigate the problem of coordinated attacks, in which the adversary initiates two attacks in order to maximize its chances of successful penetration, assuming a robot from the team will be sent to examine a penetration attempt. We suggest an algorithm that computes the optimal robot strategy for handling such coordinated attacks, and show that despite its exponential time complexity, practical run time of the algorithm can be significantly reduced without harming the opti-mality of the strategy.

We offer the first general theoretical analysis of the problem of adversarial classification, resolving several important open questions in the process. First, we significantly generalize previous results on adversarial classifier reverse engineering (ACRE), showing that if a classifier can be efficiently learned, it can subsequently be efficiently reverse engineered with arbitrary precision. We extend this result to randomized classification schemes, but now observe that reverse engineering is imperfect, and its efficacy depends on the defender's randomization scheme. Armed with this insight, we proceed to characterize optimal randomization schemes in the face of adversarial reverse engineering and classifier manipulation. What we find is quite surprising: in all the model variations we consider, the defender's optimal policy tends to be either to randomize uniformly (ignoring baseline classification accuracy), which is the case for targeted attacks, or not to randomize at all, which is typically optimal when attacks are indiscriminate.

We introduce a pass-ahead behavior, as well as a new dynamic two-stage planner, Coerce and Attack, which explicitly considers opponent defense to hypothetical attack patterns. The Coerce stage generates a coerce attack formation to coerce the opponent robots into leaving strategic openings. The Attack stage modifies the coerce attack pattern in a fluid manner to exploit openings in the defense using pass-ahead to attempt to score. We further present our threat-based defensive multi-robot algorithm, which identifies potential threats based on the opponent positioning and plans the defense accordingly.

In 2012, Yupu Hu et al. [4] relaxed adversarial power and allowed faults in random area within eight neighbouring bits at random time but with the major limitation that after each fault injection, the fault positions must not be from different registers. In this paper we present a generic attack strategy that allows the adversary to challenge the cipher under different multi-bit fault models with faults at any unknown random keystream generation round even if bit arrangement of the actual cipher device is unknown and thereby removing the limitation of Yupu Hu et al. To the best of our knowledge, this paper assumes the weakest adversarial power ever considered in the open literature for DFA on Trivium. In particular, if faults are allowed in random area within nine neighbouring bits at random time anywhere in the three registers and the fault injection (at keystream generation) rounds are uniformly distributed over {t,..., t+49}, for any unknown t ≥ 1, then 4 faults always break the cipher, which is a significant improvement over Yupu Hu et al. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",Differential Fault Attack; Multi-Bit Faults; SAT Solver; Stream Cipher,Artificial intelligence; Bioinformatics; Attack strategies; Differential fault analysis; Differential fault attack; Fault injection; Fault position; Multi-bits; SAT solvers; Stream Ciphers; Cryptography,,,,,"De CannièRe, C., Preneel, B., TRIVIUM Specifications, , http://www.ecrypt.eu.org/stream/p3ciphers/trivium/triviump3.pdf; Hojsík, M., Rudolf, B., (2008) Differential Fault Analysis of Trivium, 5086, pp. 158-172. , In: Nyberg, K.

A prominent family of DB protocols are those based on graphs, which were introduced in 2010 to resist both mafia and distance frauds. The security analysis in terms of distance fraud is performed by considering an adversary that, given a vertex labeled graph G = (V,E) and a vertex v ∈ V , is able to find the most frequent n-long sequence in G starting from v (MFS problem). However, to the best of our knowledge, it is still an open question whether the distance fraud security can be computed considering the aforementioned adversarial model. Our first contribution is a proof that the MFS problem is NP-Hard even when the graph is constrained to meet the requirements of a graph-based DB protocol. Although this result does not invalidate the model, it does suggest that a too-strong adversary is perhaps being considered (i.e., in practice, graph-based DB protocols might resist distance fraud better than the security model suggests.) Our second contribution is an algorithm addressing the distance fraud security of the tree-based approach due to Avoine and Tchamkerten. The novel algorithm improves the computational complexity O(22n+n) of the naive approach to O(22nn) where n is the number of rounds. © Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2014.",Distance bounding; Graph; Most frequent sequence; NP-complete; NP-hard; Relay attack; Security,Algorithms; Complex networks; Computational complexity; Crime; Graphic methods; Trees (mathematics); Ubiquitous computing; Distance bounding; Frequent sequences; Graph; NP Complete; NP-hard; Relay attack; Security; Graph theory,,,,,"Agrawal, R., Srikant, R., Mining sequential patterns (1995) ICDE, pp. 3-14; Avoine, G., Bingöl, M.A., Kardąs, S., Lauradoux, C., Martin, B., A framework for analyzing RFID distance bounding protocols (2011) J.

In the previously presented models attacker’s budget was assumed to be unlimited. It is natural to assume that the adversarial budget is limited and such an assumption would allow us to model the adversarial decision making more close to the one that might happen in real life. We analyze three atomic cases – the single atomic case, the atomic AND, and the atomic OR. Even these elementary cases become quite complex, at the same time, limiting adversarial budget does not seem to provide any better or more precise results compared to the failure-free models. For the limited model analysis results to be reliable, it is required that the adversarial reward is estimated with high precision, probably not achievable by providing expert estimations for the quantitative annotations on the attack steps, such as the cost or the success probability. It is doubtful that it is reasonable to face this complexity, as the failure-free model provides reliable upper bounds, being at the same time computationally less complex. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",,Atoms; Decision making; Adversarial decision making; Attack tree; Expert estimation; Free model; High-precision; Model analysis; Quantitative security assessments; Upper Bound; Budget control,,,,,"Buldas, A., Laud, P., Priisalu, J., Saarepera, M., Willemson, J., Rational choice of security measures via multi-parameter attack trees (2006) CRITIS 2006.

However, most current approaches use honeynets relying on the assumption that simply attracting intruders into honeypots would thwart the attack. In this paper, we propose a different and more realistic approach, which aims at delaying intrusions, so as to control the probability that an intruder will reach a certain goal within a specified amount of time. Our method relies on analyzing a graphical representation of the computer network's logical layout and an associated probabilistic model of the adversary's behavior. We then artificially modify this representation by adding ""distraction clusters"" - collections of interconnected virtual machines - at key points of the network in order to increase complexity for the intruders and delay the intrusion. We study this problem formally, showing it to be NP-hard and then provide an approximation algorithm that exhibits several useful properties. Finally, we present experimental results obtained on a prototypal implementation of the proposed framework.",Adversarial modeling; Graph theory; Moving target defense,Approximation algorithms; Graph theory; Graph theoretic approach; Graphical representations; Honey net; Keypoints; Moving target defense; Network intrusions; Probabilistic modeling; Useful properties; Network security,,,,,"Abbasi, F., Harris, R., Moretti, G., Haider, A., Anwar, N., Classification of malicious network streams using honeynets (2012) Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), pp. 891-897; Alpcan, T., Baar, T., (2010) Network Security: A Decision and Game-theoretic Approach, , Cambridge University Press, New York, NY, USA, 1st edition; Chen, C.-M., Cheng, S.-T., Zeng, R.-Y., A proactive approach to intrusion detection and malware collection (2013) Security and Communication Networks, 6 (7), pp. 844-853; Chen, W., Wang, C., Wang, Y., Scalable influence maximization for prevalent viral marketing in large-scale social networks (2010) Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 1029-1038; Evans, D., Nguyen-Tuong, A., Knight, J.C., (2011) Moving Target Defense: Creating Asymmetric Uncertainty for Cyber Threats, pp. 29-48. , chapter Effectiveness of Moving Target Defenses, Springer; Feige, U., A threshold of ln n for approximating set cover (1998) J.

The system consists of detection and RF response infrastructure, implemented in the FPGA of a USRP N210 and designed to function with the open source GNU Radio SDR library. The framework can be used to implement a fast turnaround reactive jamming system capable of timely RF response within \textit{80ns} of signal detection. Our framework also allows for full control and feedback from the FPGA hardware to the GNU Radio-based cognitive radio backend, making it applicable to a wide range of preamble-based wireless communication schemes. This paper presents the capabilities, design, and experimental evaluation of this framework. Using this platform, we demonstrate real-time reactive jamming capabilities in both WiFi (802.11g) and mobile WiMAX (802.16e) networks and quantify jamming performances by measuring the network throughput using the iperf software tool. The results indicate that our system works reliably in real time as a reactive jammer and can be used for practical assessments of modern jamming and secure communication techniques. © 2014 ACM.",denial of service; reactive jamming; software radios,Denial-of-service attack; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Open source software; Open systems; Radio receivers; Software radio; Wi-Fi; Wireless telecommunication systems; Denial of Service; Experimental evaluation; FPGA hardwares; Jamming systems; Network throughput; Secure communications; Software-defined radios; Wireless communications; Jamming,,,,,"http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio; http://warpproject.org; Bayraktaroglu, E., King, C., Liu, X., Noubir, G., Rajaraman, R., Thapa, B., On the Performance of IEEE 802.11 under Jamming (2008) Proc. of INFOCOM, pp. 1265-1273. , volume 0448330, Apr; Chen, J., Sen, S., Chiang, M., Dorsey, D.J., A Framework for Energy-efficient Adaptive Jamming of Adversarial Communications Proc. of CISS, 2013; Gollakota, S., Katabi, D., (2010) IJam: Jamming Oneself for Secure Wireless Communication, , Technical report, MIT; Gollakota, S., Katabi, D., Physical layer wireless security made fast and channel independent (2011) Proc. of IEEE INFOCOM, pp. 1125-1133. , Apr; Li, M., Koutsopoulos, I., Poovendran, R., Optimal Jamming Attacks and Network Defense Policies in Wireless Sensor Networks (2007) Proc. of IEEE INFOCOM, pp. 1307-1315; Liu, Y., Ning, P., BitTrickle: Defending against broadband and high-power reactive jamming attacks (2012) Proc. of IEEE INFOCOM, pp. 909-917. , Mar; Pongthawornkamol, T., Nahrstedt, K., Alibi Framework for Identifying Reactive Jamming Nodes in Wireless LAN Proc. of IEEE GLOBECOM, Dec. 2011; Prasad, S., Thuente, D.J., Jamming attacks in 802.11g - A cognitive radio based approach (2011) Proc. of IEEE MILCOM, pp. 1219-1224. , Nov; Shen, W., Ning, P., He, X., Dai, H., Ally Friendly Jamming: How to Jam Your Enemy and Maintain Your Own Wireless Connectivity at the Same Time (2013) Proc. of IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 174-188. , May; Shin, I., Shen, Y., Xuan, Y., Thai, M.T., Znati, T., A Novel Approach Against Reactive Jamming Attacks (2011) Journal of Ad Hoc & Sensor Wireless Networks, 12 (1-2), pp. 125-149; Thuente, D.J., Acharya, M., Intelligent jamming in wireless networks with applications to 802.11b and other networks (2006) Proc. of IEEE MILCOM, pp. 1075-1081; Wilhelm, M., Martinovic, I., Schmitt, J.B., Lenders, V., Reactive Jamming in Wireless Networks - How Realistic is the Threat?

Typically, they use a fixed operating point minimizing the expected cost / error. This allows a rational attacker to deliver invisible attacks just below the detection threshold. We model this situation as a non-zero sum normal form game capturing attacker's expected payoffs for detected and undetected attacks, and detector's costs for false positives and false negatives computed based on the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of the classifier. The analysis of Nash and Stackelberg equilibria reveals that using a randomized strategy over multiple operating points forces the rational attacker to design less efficient attacks and substantially lowers the expected cost of the detector.

Therefore, random number generation is one of the most critical primitives for cryptography. This paper focuses on true random number generators (TRNGs) and the analysis of their security requirements. After illustrating issues associated with adversarial influences on TRNGs, we propose a simple method to obtain a secure TRNG based on n TRNGs originating from (potentially) untrusted vendors. The untrusted generators are combined such that as long as one out of the n vendors does not collude with the other vendors, the generator is secure, i.e., the output is unpredictable and uniformly distributed even in the presence of an active attacker. In order to achieve this, we review several choices of functions to be used as combiner. The advantage of our design is that only the (black-box) input-output behavior of the vendor's TRNGs needs to be evaluated. No overhead is introduced by the combiner. The resulting generator offers faultresilience and ease of maintenance. © 2014 IEEE.",Attacks on TRNGs; Cryptography; Fault-tolerance; Hardware Trojans; Random Number Generator (RNG); Resilient functions,Cryptography; Fault tolerance; Malware; Number theory; Attacks on TRNGs; Cryptographic applications; Cryptographic random numbers; Hardware Trojans; Input-output behavior; Random number generators; Resilient function; Security requirements; Random number generation,,,,,"Goldberg, I., Wagner, D., Randomness and the netscape browser (1996) Dr Dobb's Journal-Software Tools for the Professional Programmer, 21 (1), pp. 66-71. , January; Dorrendorf, L., Gutterman, Z., Pinkas, B., Cryptanalysis of the random number generator of the windows operating system (2009) ACM TISSEC, 13 (1), pp. 101-1032. , Nov; Gutterman, Z., Pinkas, B., Reinman, T., Analysis of the linux random number generator (2006) Security and Privacy, 2006 IEEE Symposium on, pp. 370-385; Yilek, S., Resettable public-key encryption: How to encrypt on a virtual machine (2010) Topics in Cryptology-CT-RSA 2010, Ser.

Traditional brute-force, high-rate DDoS attacks expose many obvious anomaly features to defense systems, so that they can be easily detected and mitigated. In this paper we propose a new type of low-rate TCP-targeted DoS attack, called NewShrew, which exploits the deficiencies in TCP's timeout mechanism and slow start mechanism. This attack could significantly degrade TCP throughput, while evading the supervision of DoS prevention systems by inconspicuously consuming a small part of network capacity. We use theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of this attack for different RTT heterogeneity, TCP variant, and network environment. We reveal the interactions among the attack parameters, and the trade-offs between throughput degradation and attack cost. Moreover, we empirically show that NewShrew outperforms the classical Shrew DoS attack in terms of lower average attack rate (averagely 47.82%), higher attack efficiency (the ratio between throughput degradation inflicted by an attack and the average attack rate of the attack) with an average of 45.79%, and higher throughput degradation (averagely 11.54%) after deploying a typical defense mechanism (namely, RTO randomization). Our work innovatively exposes TCP slow start mechanism as a possible vulnerability to adversarial attacks, hence it opens new avenue to improving the resilience of TCP. © 2014 IEEE.",Denial of Service; low-rate attack; TCP slow start,Computer simulation; Network security; Throughput; Transmission control protocol; Defense mechanism; Denial of Service; Distributed denial of service attack; low-rate attack; Network environments; Prevention systems; TCP slow starts; Throughput degradation; Denial-of-service attack,,,,,"Kuzmanovic, A., Knightly, E.W., Low-rate TCP-targeted denial of service attacks (the shrew vs. The mice and elephants) (2003) Proc.

Experience shows that security experts usually prefer using their own ad-hoc model than the existing ones. In particular, the impossibility of the models to refine the privacy assessment of different protocols has been highlighted in several studies. The paper emphasizes the necessity to define a new model capable of comparing protocols meaningfully. It introduces an untraceability model that is operational where the previous models are not. The model aims to be easily usable to design proofs or describe attacks. This spirit led to a modular model where adversary actions (oracles), capabilities (selectors and restrictions), and goals (experiment) follow an intuitive and practical approach. This design enhances the ability to formalize new adversarial assumptions and future evolutions of the technology, and provide a finest privacy evaluation of protocols. © 2012 IEEE.",and protection; integrity; Pervasive computing; Security; Systems and Information Theory,Computer networks; Mobile computing; and protection; Different protocols; integrity; Modular modeling; Security; Security experts; Systems and information; Un traceabilitys; Ubiquitous computing,,,,,"Avoine, G., RFID Security & Privacy Lounge, , http://www.avoine.net/rfid/, by the UCL's Information Security Group [Online].

We consider a legitimate transmitter-receiver pair connected over multiple communication paths (routes). We propose two new models of adversary, a 'memoryless' and a 'foreseer' adversary. For both models, the adversaries are placing themselves arbitrarily on the routes, keeping their placement fixed throughout the transmission block. This placement may or may not be known to the transmitter. The adversaries can choose their best modification strategy to increase the error at the legitimate receiver, subject to a maximum distortion constraint. We investigate the communication rates that can be achieved in the presence of the two types of adversaries and the channel (benign) stochastic behavior. For memoryless adversaries, the capacity is derived. Our method is to use the typical set of the anticipated received signal for all possible adversarial strategies (including their best one) in a compound channel that also captures adversarial placement. For the foreseer adversaries, which have enhanced observation capabilities compared to the memoryless ones, we propose a new coding scheme to guarantee resilience, i.e., recovery of the codeword independently of the adversarial (best) choice. We derive an achievable rate and we propose an upper bound on the capacity. We evaluate our general results for specific cases (e.g., binary symbol replacement or erasing attacks), to gain insights. © 2014 IEEE.",,Stochastic systems; Transmitters; Active adversary; Communication path; Communication rate; Data modification; Received signals; Reliable communication; Stochastic behavior; Transmission block; Information theory,,,,,"Papadimitratos, P., Haas, Z.J., Secure data communication in mobile Ad Hoc networks (2006) IEEE JSAC, 24 (2), pp. 343-356. , Feb; Dolev, D., Dwork, C., Waarts, O., Yung, M., Perfectly secure message transmission (1993) J.

As malicious code and network attacks become more sophisticated, classic signature-based virus and malware detection methods are less effective. To augment the current malware methods of detection, we developed a proactive approach to detect emerging malware threats using open source tools and intelligence to discover patterns and behaviors of malicious attacks and adversaries. Technical and analytical skills are combined to track adversarial behavior, methods and techniques. We established a controlled (separated domain) network to identify, monitor, and track malware behavior to increase understanding of the methods and techniques used by cyber adversaries. We created a suite of tools that observe the network and system performance looking for anomalies that may be caused by malware. The toolset collects information from open-source tools and provides meaningful indicators that the system was under or has been attacked. When malware is discovered, we analyzed and reverse engineered it to determine how it could be detected and prevented. Results have shown that with minimum resources, cost effective capabilities can be developed to detect abnormal behavior that may indicate malicious software. © 2014 SPIE.",Anomaly-based detection; Malware; Signature-based detection; Zero-day,Computer viruses; Network coding; Viruses; Abnormal behavior; Anomaly-based detections; Malicious software; Malware behaviors; Malware detection; Open source tools; Pro-active approach; Zero-day; Malware,,,,,"Santos, I., Penya, Y.K., Devesa, J., Bringas, P.G., N-Grams-based file signatures for malware detection (2009) The 11th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems (ICEIS), , Milan, Italy; Kolbitsch, C., Comparetti, P.M., Kruegel, C., Kirda, E., Zhou, X., Wang, X., Effective and efficient malware detection at the end host (2009) 18 USENIX Security Symposium, Montreal, , Canada; (2014), https://www.symantec.com/security_response/publications/, http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/ other-resources/b- intelligence-report-01-2014.en-us.pdf January, [Accessed 31 March 2014]; Gyanchandani, M., Rana, L.J., Yadav, N.R., Taxonomy of anomaly based intrusion detection system: A review (2012) International Jouranal of Scientific and Research Publications, 2 (12); Scarfone, L., Mell, P., (2007) Guide to Intrusion Detectin and Prevention Systems (IDPS), , csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs; Nwokedi, M.A., A survey of malware detection techniques (2007) Department of Computer Science, , Purdue University; Jyothsan, V., Prasad, V.V.R., Prasad, K.M., A review of anomaly based intrusion (2011) International Journal of Computer Applications, 28 (7), pp. 26-35; Vacca, J.R., (2009) Computer and Information Security, , Burlington, MA: Morgan Kaufmann; Zhang, L., White, G.B., An approach to detect executable content for anomaly based network intrusion detection (2007) Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium, IEEE International, , Long Beach, CA; Broz, A., Signature-based or anomaly-based intrusion detection: The practice and pitfalls (2002) SC Magazine for IT Security Professionals, , 1 May; Sanabria, A., (2007) Malware Analysis: Environment Design and Architecture, , http://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/threats/malware-analysis- environment-design-artitecture-1841, 18 January; Desktop operating system market share (2014) Net Market Share, , http://www.netmarketshare.com, Net Market Share, February.

Much of the current and past work has focused on algorithm development, data processing, and optimization. Lately, a subset of research has emerged which explores issues related to security. This research is gaining traction as systems employing these methods are being applied to both secure and adversarial environments. One of machine learning's biggest benefits, its data-driven versus logic-driven approach, is also a weakness if the data on which the models rely are corrupted. Adversaries could maliciously influence systems which address drift and data distribution changes using re-training and online learning. Our work is focused on exploring the resilience of various machine learning algorithms to these data-driven attacks. In this paper, we present our initial findings using Monte Carlo simulations, and statistical analysis, to explore the maximal achievable shift to a classification model, as well as the required amount of control over the data.",Adversarial Machine Learning; Hidden Markov Models; Intrusion Detection; Monte Carlo,Artificial intelligence; Computation theory; Computer programming; E-learning; Hidden Markov models; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Monte Carlo methods; Online systems; Adversarial environments; Algorithm development; Classification models; Conventional computers; Data distribution; Online learning; Programming logic; Learning algorithms,,,,,"Ariu, D., (2010) Host and Network Based Anomaly Detectors for HTTP Attacks, , Diss.

Recent work has introduced a methodology for the security analysis of data clustering in adversarial settings, aimed to identify potential attacks against clustering algorithms and to evaluate their impact. The authors have shown that single-linkage hierarchical clustering can be severely affected by the presence of a very small fraction of carefully-crafted poisoning attacks into the input data, highlighting that the clustering algorithm may be itself the weakest link in a security system. In this paper, we extend this analysis to the case of complete-linkage hierarchical clustering by devising an ad hoc poisoning attack. We verify its effectiveness on artificial data and on application examples related to the clustering of malware and handwritten digits. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,Malware; Pattern recognition; Security systems; Syntactics; Application examples; Clustering process; Handwritten digit; Hier-archical clustering; Malicious activities; Poisoning attacks; Security analysis; Security application; Clustering algorithms,,,,,"Perdisci, R., Corona, I., Giacinto, G., Early detection of malicious flux networks via large-scale passive DNS traffic analysis (2012) IEEE Trans.

Many applications of networks WSN are developed. In the last years, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have gained increasing attention from both the research community and actual users. As sensor nodes are generally battery-powered devices, the critical aspects to face concern how to reduce the energy consumption of nodes, so that the network lifetime can be extended to reasonable times. As sensor networks are deployed in adversarial environments and used for critical applications. In this paper, we consider routing security in wireless sensor networks. Many sensor network routing protocols have been proposed, but very less of them have been designedwith security as a goal. We propose security goals for routing in sensor networks. We describe crippling attacks against all of them and suggest countermeasures and design considerations. © 2014 Bijoy Kumar Mandal, Debnath Bhattacharyya and Kil-hwan Shin.",CTS; IGF; ORT; RFID; WSN,,,,,,"Akyildiz, I.F., Su, W., Sankarasubramaniam, Y., Cayirci, E., Wireless Sensor Networks: a Survey (2002) Computer Networks, 38 (4); Hu, Y.C., Perrig, A., Johnson, D.B., Wormhole detection in wireless ad hoc networks (2002) Department of Computer Science, pp. 1-384. , Rice University; Hill, J., Szewczyk, R., Woo, A., Hollar, S., Culler, D., Pister, K., System architecture directions for networked sensors (2000) in Proceedings of ACM, , ASPLOS IX; Sanzgiri, K., Dahill, B., Levine, B.N., Shields, C., Belding-Royer, E.M., A secure routing protocol for ad hoc networks (2002) In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols(ICNP); Karlof, C., Wagner, D., Secure routing in wireless sensor networks: Attacks and countermeasures (2003) In First IEEE International Workshop on Sensor Network Protocols and Applications, pp. 1-15; Xu, Y., Heidemann, J., Estrin, D., Energy conservation by adaptive clustering for ad-hoc networks (2002) in Poster Session of MobiHoc","Shin, K.-H.; Department of business IT, Kookmin University, Seoul, South Korea",,,Hikari Ltd.,,,,,13136569,,,,English,Contemporary Engineering Sciences,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84906230782

The link is modeled as a set of binary channels controlled by a strategic jammer whose intention is to wage a 'denial of service' attack on the plant by choosing a most damaging channel-switching strategy. The paper introduces a class of zero-sum games between the jammer and controller as a scenario for such attack, and derives necessary and sufficient conditions for these games to have a nontrivial saddle-point equilibrium. At this equilibrium, the jammer's optimal policy is to randomize in a region of the plant's state space, thus requiring the controller to undertake a nontrivial response which is different from what one would expect in a standard stochastic control problem over a packet dropping channel. © 2014 American Automatic Control Council.",Networked control systems,Denial-of-service attack; Jamming; Networked control systems; Binary channels; Control problems; Denial of Service; Optimal policies; Packet dropping; Saddle-point equilibriums; Stochastic control; Zero-sum game; Controllers,,,,,"Tatikonda, S., Mitter, S., Control under communication constraints (2004) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 49 (7), pp. 1056-1068; Nair, G., Fagnani, F., Zampieri, S., Evans, R., Feedback control under data rate constraints: An overview (2007) Proceedings of the IEEE, 95 (1), pp. 108-137; Yüksel, S., Başar, T., Minimum rate coding for LTI systems over noiseless channels (2006) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 51 (12), pp. 1878-1887; Minero, P., Franceschetti, M., Dey, S., Nair, G., Data rate theorem for stabilization over time-varying feedback channels (2009) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 54 (2), pp. 243-255; Martins, N., Dahleh, M., Elia, N., Feedback stabilization of uncertain systems in the presence of a direct link (2006) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 51 (3), pp. 438-447; Schenato, L., Sinopoli, B., Franceschetti, M., Poolla, K., Sastry, S., Foundations of control and estimation over lossy networks (2007) Proceedings of the IEEE, 95 (1), pp. 163-187; Imer, O., Yüksel, S., Başar, T., Optimal control of LTI systems over unreliable communication links (2006) Automatica, 42 (9), pp. 1429-1439; Garone, E., Sinopoli, B., Casavola, A., LQG control over lossy TCP-like networks with probabilistic packet acknowledgements (2010) International Journal of Systems, Control and Communications, 2 (1), pp. 55-81; Amin, S., Cárdenas, A., Sastry, S., Safe and secure networked control systems under denial-of-service attacks (2009) Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control, pp. 31-45; Gupta, A., Langbort, C., Başar, T., Optimal control in the presence of an intelligent jammer with limited actions (2010) Proc. of 49th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC), pp. 1096-1101. , December; Csiszár, I., Narayan, P., Arbitrarily varying channels with constrained inputs and states (1988) IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 34 (1), pp. 27-34; Başar, T., Wuh, Y.-W., A complete characterization of minimax and maximin encoder-decoder policies for communication channels with incomplete statistical description (1985) IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 31 (4); Boyd, S., Vandenberghe, L., (2003) Convex Optimization, , Cambridge University Press; Başar, T., Olsder, G., (1982) Dynamic Noncooperative Game Theory, , Academic Press; Langbort, C., Ugrinovskii, V., One-shot control over an AVC-like adversarial channel (2012) Proc. of 2012 American Control Conference, , Montreal, Canada",,,Boeing;et al.;GE Global Research;Honeywell;MathWorks;Mitsubishi,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2014 American Control Conference, ACC 2014",4 June 2014 through 6 June 2014,"Portland, OR",106827,7431619,9.78148E+12,PRACE,,English,Proc Am Control Conf,Conference Paper,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905686767

History shows, however, that the privacy of anonymised data in many cases is easily broken by de-anonymisation attacks. This paper defines guiding principles for decisions about releasing anonymised data and provides a simple process for analysing de-anonymisation risk and for making decisions about publishing anonymised personal data. At the heart of this process is an information-theoretic de-anonymisation feasibility limit that is independent of the details of both the anonymisation procedure and the adversarial de-anonymisation algorithms. This feasibility limit relates the adversarial mutual information of the anonymised data and the attacker's background information to the number of records in the anonymised data base and the acceptable risk of privacy violations. Based on this result, we explain, discuss and exemplify the process for making decisions about releasing anonymised data. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Since UEs are becoming increasingly more powerful both in computational power and in the role they have in the network, a concrete threat is that a hand-held D2D-enabled device could be deployed to jam intentionally ongoing transmissions of other D2D users. In this context, a natural concern for operators will be the resilience of the legitimate user (LU) against a jammer's (J) attack. In this work, we model an LTE D2D system made of a pair of LUs and a J that tries to impair their communication. We model the adversarial scenario between the transmitting LU and J as a zero-sum game: in this game, J's target is to minimize the throughput of the legitimate D2D pair. We show the achievable channel rate of the D2D pair under jamming attacks and the existence of a Nash equilibrium. Finally, when both players learn each other strategy over time, e.g., employing fictitious play, such equilibrium becomes the system's operating point. © 2014 ICST.",,Cognitive radio; Game theory; Jamming; Wireless networks; Computational power; Deviceto-device (D2D) communication; Fictitious play; Jamming attacks; Legitimate users; Nash equilibria; Operating points; Secondary networks; Wireless telecommunication systems,,,,,"Wang, B., Wu, Y., Liu, K.J.R., Optimal power allocation strategy against jamming attacks using the colonel blotto game (2009) IEEE GLOBECOM Proc., pp. 1-5; Wu, K.R.L.Y., Wang, B., Clancy, T.C., Anti-jamming games in multi-channel cognitive radio networks (2012) IEEE Commun., 30 (1), pp. 1-12; Zhou, B., Hu, H., Huang, S.-Q., Chen, H.-H., Intracluster deviceto- device relay algorithm with optimal resource utilization (2013) IEEE Trans. on Veh.

In this paper, we demonstrate the adversarial model of this type of protocols and show that Hsieh-Leu scheme is not as secure as they originally claimed to be. In particular, we show that their protocol does not provide user privacy protection, and it is vulnerable to off-line password guessing attack mounted by a side channel adversary who has compromised all the information stored in the user's smart card. To fix these weaknesses, a new practical authentication protocol with anonymity for wireless roaming is proposed. We use the formal verification tool ProVerif, which is based on applied pi calculus, to prove the security of the proposed scheme. The experimental results confirm that the new scheme not only achieves many desirable properties, such as strong anonymity, perfect forward secrecy and support of session key update, but also provides robustness against all those attacks that Hsieh-Leu protocol does not resist. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Authentication; Roaming; User anonymity; Wireless networks,Calculations; Side channel attack; Smart cards; Wireless networks; Anonymous authentication; Authentication protocols; Formal verification tools; Offline password guessing attack; Perfect forward secrecy; Roaming; User anonymity; Wireless access networks; Authentication,,,,,"Zhu, J., Ma, J., A new authentication scheme with anonymity for wireless environments (2004) IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics, 50 (1), pp. 230-234; Lee, C.C., Hwang, M.S., Liao, I.E., Security enhancement on a new authentication scheme with anonymity for wireless environments (2006) IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics, 53 (5), pp. 1683-1687; Chang, C.C., Lee, C.Y., Chiu, Y.C., Enhanced authentication scheme with anonymity for roaming service in global mobility networks (2009) Computer Communications, 32 (4), pp. 611-618; Wu, C.C., Lee, W.B., Tsaur, W.J., A secure authentication scheme with anonymity for wireless communications (2008) IEEE Communications Letters, 12 (10), pp. 722-723; Youn, T.Y., Park, Y.H., Li, M.J., Weaknesses in an anonymous authentication scheme for roaming service in global mobility networks (2009) IEEE Communications Letters, 13 (7), pp. 1118-1123; Chen, Y.C., Chuang, S.C., Yeh, L.Y., Huang, J.L., A practical authentication protocol with anonymity for wireless access networks (2011) Wireless Communications & Mobile Computing, 11, pp. 1366-1375; Mun, H., Han, K., Lee, Y.S., Yeun, C.Y., Choi, H.H., Enhanced secure anonymous authentication scheme for roaming service in global mobility networks (2012) Mathematical and Computer Modelling, 55 (1-2), pp. 214-222; Niu, J., Li, X., A novel user authentication scheme with anonymity for wireless communications (2012) Security and Communication Networks, , DOI: 10.1002/sec.601; Yang, G., Huang, Q., Wong, D.S., Deng, X., Universal authentication protocols for anonymous wireless communications (2010) IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, 9 (1), pp. 168-174; Hsieh, W.B., Leu, J.S., Anonymous authentication protocol based on elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman for wireless access networks (2012) Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing, , Available Online DOI: 10.1002/wcm.2252; Abadi, M., Blanchet, B., Lundh, H.C., (2009), pp. 35-49. , Models and Proofs of Protocol Security: A Progress Report, 21st International Conference on Computer Aided Verification (CAV'09), Grenoble, France; Abadi, M., Fournet, C., (2001), pp. 104-115. , Mobile Values, New Names, and Secure Communication, 28th ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL'01); Dolev, D., Yao, A.C., On the security of public-key protocols (1983) IEEE Transaction on Information Theory, 2 (29), pp. 198-208; Kocher, P., Jaffe, J., Jun, B., (1999), pp. 388-397. , Differential Power Analysis, Proc.

A typical case is the interplay between the sensor-based camera source identification and fingerprint-copy attack. This paper gives a game theory analysis in such an adversarial environment. We use a counter anti-forensic method based on noise level estimation to detect the possible forgery (forgery test). Next, we introduce a game theory model to evaluate the ultimate performance when both the investigator and the forger have complete information. Finally, for a more practical scenario that one of the parties has incomplete information, a Bayesian game is introduced and the ultimate performance is compared with that of complete information game. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Anti-forensic; Bayesian game; Camera source identification; Game theory,Cameras; Adversarial environments; Anti-forensic; Bayesian game; Complete information; Game theory models; Incomplete information; Noise level estimation; Source identification; Game theory,,,,,"Lukas, J., Fridrich, J., Goljan, M., Digital camera identification from sensor noise (2006) IEEE Trans.

Specifically, this paper considers a scenario in which an analyst has to accept or reject the null hypothesis H0 characterized by a probability mass function (pmf) PX based on the evidence provided by a test sequence. In turn, the goal of the adversary is to take a sequence generated according to a different pmf and modify it in such a way to induce a decision error. P X is known only through one or more training sequences. We derive the asymptotic equilibrium of the game under the assumption that the analyst relies only on first order statistics of the test and training sequences, and compute the asymptotic payoff of the game when the length of the sequences tends to infinity. We introduce the concept of indistinguishability region, defined as the set of pmfs that can not be distinguished reliably from PX in the presence of attacks. Two different scenarios are considered: in the first one the analyst and the adversary share the same training sequence, in the second scenario, they rely on independent sequences. The obtained results are compared with a version of the game in which the pmf PX is perfectly known to both the analyst and the adversary. © 2014 IEEE.",adversarial signal processing; counter-forensics; cybersecurity; game theory; Hypothesis testing; multimedia forensics; source identification,Game theory; Radio systems; Signal processing; Statistical tests; Counter-Forensics; Cyber security; Hypothesis testing; Multimedia forensics; Source identification; Acceptance tests,,,,,"Barni, M., Pérez-González, F., Coping with the enemy: Advances in adversary-aware signal processing (2013) Proc.

Conventional access control methods are not suitable to prevent such vulnerabilities because they use one set of permissions for all system call invocations. In this paper, we define a novel policy model for describing when resource retrievals are unsafe, so they can be blocked. This model highlights two contributions: (1) the explicit definition of adversary models as adversarial roles, which list the permissions that dictate whether one subject is an adversary of another, and (2) the application of data-flow to determine the adversary control of the names used to retrieve resources. An evaluation using multiple adversary models shows that data-flow is necessary to authorize resource retrieval in over 90% of system calls. By making adversary models and the adversary accessibility of all aspects of resource retrieval explicit, we can block resource access attacks system-wide.",Protection; Resource access attacks,Access control; Intrusion detection; Adversary models; Control methods; Operating environment; Policy model; Protection; Resource access; Resource retrieval; System calls; Information retrieval,,,,,"(1998) RBAC'98: Proceedings of the Third ACM Workshop on Role-based Access Control, , New York, NY, USA, ACM.

They aim at reducing the randomness requirements of masking schemes under certain (adversarial and implementation) conditions. Previous works have put forward the interest of this approach when such conditions are met. We complement these investigations by analyzing LEMS against adversaries and implementations that deviate from their expected behavior, in a realistic manner.

Rennes 1, Rennes, France; Vaudenay, S., EPFL Lausanne, Switzerland","In many cases, we can only have access to a service by proving we are sufficiently close to a particular location (e.g. in automobile or building access control). In these cases, proximity can be guaranteed through signal attenuation. However, by using additional transmitters an attacker can relay signals between the prover and the verifier. Distance-bounding protocols are the main countermeasure against such attacks; however, such protocols may leak information regarding the location of the prover and/or the verifier who run the distance-bounding protocol. In this paper, we consider a formal model for location privacy in the context of distance-bounding. In particular, our contributions are threefold: we first define a security game for location privacy in distance bounding; secondly, we define an adversarial model for this game, with two adversary classes; finally, we assess the feasibility of attaining location privacy for distance-bounding protocols. Concretely, we prove that for protocols with a beginning or a termination, it is theoretically impossible to achieve location privacy for either of the two adversary classes, in the sense that there always exists a polynomially-bounded adversary winning the security game. However, for so-called limited adversaries, who cannot see the location of arbitrary provers, carefully chosen parameters do, in practice, enable computational location privacy. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To protect them against the greatest risks, a well-functioning risk management process is required to develop appropriate safety and security strategies. There are many wellestablished risk analysis methods existing. They predominantly apply empirical models and statistical data to quantify the risks. Within the realms of natural or aleatory risks this approach is considered suitable and functional. However, it could be a fatal flaw to apply such conventional, history-orientated models in order to assess risks that arise from intelligent adversaries such as terrorists, criminals or competitors. Approaches of classic risk analysis generally describe adversaries' choices as random variables, thus excluding the adversaries' behaviour and ability to adapt to security strategies. One possibility for considering human behaviour when analysing risks is the recourse to game theory. Game theory is the paradigmatic framework for strategic decision-making when two or more rational decision-makers (intelligent adversaries) are involved in cooperative or conflictive decision situations. In our study we propose an approach for combining a classic risk analysis method with a game-theoretic approach. Using a defenderoffender game as a basis, we simulate, exemplary for a terrorist attack against public transport, the behaviour and reactions (to applied security strategies of the defender) of a rational player acting as an adversary. Although risk analysis and game theory are very different methodologies, we show that linking them can significantly improve the quality of forecasts and risk assessments. If the behaviour and reactions of intelligent adversaries need to be considered, our approach contributes to enhance security through improving the allocation of scarce financial resources. © 2014 WIT Press.",Adversarial risks; Game theory; Risk; Risk analysis,Computer simulation; Decision making; Game theory; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risks; Decision situation; Financial resources; Risk analysis methods; Risk management process; Safety and securities; Security strategies; Strategic decision making; Terrorist attacks; Risk analysis,,,,,"Hall Jr., J.R., The elephant in the room is called game theory (2009) Risk Analysis, 29 (8), p. 1061; Abou El Kalam, A., Deswarte, Y., Baïna, A., Kaâniche, M., Polyorbac: A security framework for critical infrastructures (2009) International Journal of Critical Infrastructure Protection, 2 (4), pp. 154-169; Freudenberg, D., (2007) Theorie Des Irregularen: Partisanen, Guerillas Und Terroristen Im Modernen Kleinkrieg, , Vs Verlag Fur Sozialwissenschaften; Knight, F.H., (1921) Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit, , Hart, Schaffner and Marx and Houghton Mifflin: Boston MA, new edition; Bonß, W., Risk. dealing with uncertainty in modern times (2013) Social Change Review, 11 (1); Ayyub, B.M., (2003) Risk Analysis In Engineering and Economics, , Chapman & Hall/CRC: Boca Raton, Fl; (2009) Risk Management - Principles and Guidelines, , International Organization for Standardization, ISO 31000:2009), ISO, 1st edition; Kaplan, R.S., Garrick, B.J., On the quantitative definition of risk (1981) Risk Analysis, 1 (1), pp. 11-27; Haimes, Y.Y., On the definition of vulnerabilities in measuring risks to infrastructures (2006) Risk Analysis, 26 (2), pp. 293-296; Aven, T., Renn, O., On risk defined as an event where the outcome is uncertain (2009) Journal of Risk Research, 12 (1), pp. 1-11; Aven, T., Renn, O., (2010) Risk Management and Governance, , Springer: Berlin and Heidelberg; French, S., Morton, A., Renn, O., Special issue on risk management (2013) EURO Journal On Decision Processes, 1 (3-4), pp. 165-168; Hubbard, D.W., (2009) The Failure of Risk Management: Why It's Broken and How to Fix It, , Wiley: Hoboken and NJ; Aven, T., (2008) Risk Analysis: Assessing Uncertainties Beyond Expected Values and Probabilities, , Wiley: Hoboken and NJ and USA; Purdy, G., Iso 31000:2009-setting a new standard for risk management (2010) Risk Analysis, 30 (6), pp. 881-886; Parnell, G.S., Smith, C.M., Moxley, F.I., Intelligent adversary risk analysis: A bioterrorism risk management model (2010) Risk Analysis, 30 (1), pp. 32-48; Dillon, R.L., Liebe, R.M., Bestafka, T., Risk-based decision making for terrorism applications (2009) Risk Analysis, 29 (3), pp. 321-335; Ezell, B.C., Bennett, S.P., Winterfeldt, D.V., Sokolowski, J., Collins, A.J., Probabilistic risk analysis and terrorism risk (2010) Risk Analysis, 30 (4), pp. 575-589; Myerson, R., (1991) Game Theory: Analysis of Conflict, , Harvard University Press: Cambridge and Mass; Dixit, A.K., Skeath, S., (2004) Games of Strategy, , W.W.

However, little has been done to understand and verify the formal security guarantees of proposed secure inter-domain routing protocols, such as Secure BGP (S-BGP). In this paper, we develop a sound program logic for SANDLog-a declarative specification language for secure routing protocols-for verifying properties of these protocols. We prove invariant properties of SANDLog programs that run in an adversarial environment. As a step towards automated verification, we implement a verification condition generator (VCGen) to automatically extract proof obligations. VCGen is integrated into a compiler for SANDLog that can generate executable protocol implementations; and thus, both verification and empirical evaluation of secure routing protocols can be carried out in this unified framework. To validate our framework, we (1) encoded several proposed secure routing mechanisms in SANDLog, (2) verified variants of path authenticity properties by manually discharging the generated verification conditions in Coq, and (3) generated executable code based on SANDLog specification and ran the code in simulation. © 2014 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",,Formal logic; Specification languages; Theorem proving; Adversarial environments; Automated verification; Empirical evaluations; Invariant properties; Protocol implementation; Secure inter-domain routing; Secure routing protocols; Verification condition; Routing protocols,,,,,"ns 3 Project: Network Simulator 3, , http://www.nsnam.org/; Arnaud, M., Cortier, V., Delaune, S., Modeling and verifying ad hoc routing protocols Proceedings of CSF (2010); Arnaud, M., Cortier, V., Delaune, S., Deciding security for protocols with recursive tests (2011) LNCS, 6803, pp. 49-63. , Bjørner, N., Sofronie-Stokkermans, V.

While defenders leverage capabilities to minimize the potential impact of an attack, the adversary is simultaneously developing countermeasures to the observed defenses. In this study, we develop a set of tools to model the adaptive strategy formulation of an intelligent actor against an active cyber defensive system. We encode strategies as binary chromosomes representing finite state machines that evolve according to Holland's genetic algorithm. We study the strategic considerations including overall actor reward balanced against the complexity of the determined strategies. We present a series of simulation results demonstrating the ability to automatically search a large strategy space for optimal resultant fitness against a variety of counter-strategies.",Cyber security;

A realistic model is to assume that leakages are sufficiently noisy, following real-world observations. While the noisy leakage assumption has first been studied in the seminal work of Chari et al. (CRYPTO 99), the recent work of Prouff and Rivain (Eurocrypt 2013) provides the first analysis of a full masking scheme under a physically motivated noise model. Unfortunately, the security analysis of Prouff and Rivain has three important shortcomings: (1) it requires leak-free gates, (2) it considers a restricted adversarial model (random message attacks), and (3) the security proof has limited application for cryptographic settings. In this work, we provide an alternative security proof in the same noisy model that overcomes these three challenges. We achieve this goal by a new reduction from noisy leakage to the important theoretical model of probing adversaries (Ishai et al - CRYPTO 2003). Our work can be viewed as a next step of closing the gap between theory and practice in leakage resilient cryptography: while our security proofs heavily rely on concepts of theoretical cryptography, we solve problems in practically motivated leakage models. © 2014 International Association for Cryptologic Research.",,Network security; Cryptographic implementation; Leakage-resilience; Leakage-resilient cryptographies; Masking schemes; Security analysis; Security proofs; Theoretical modeling; Theory and practice; Cryptography,,,,,"Akavia, A., Goldwasser, S., Vaikuntanathan, V., Simultaneous Hardcore Bits and Cryptography against Memory Attacks (2009) LNCS, 5444, pp. 474-495. , Reingold, O.

This is a major concern since modern control systems are becoming large and decentralized and thus more vulnerable to attacks. This paper is concerned with the estimation and control of linear systems when some of the sensors or actuators are corrupted by an attacker. We give a new simple characterization of the maximum number of attacks that can be detected and corrected as a function of the pair (A,C) of the system and we show in particular that it is impossible to accurately reconstruct the state of a system if more than half the sensors are attacked. In addition, we show how the design of a secure local control loop can improve the resilience of the system. When the number of attacks is smaller than a threshold, we propose an efficient algorithm inspired from techniques in compressed sensing to estimate the state of the plant despite attacks. We give a theoretical characterization of the performance of this algorithm and we show on numerical simulations that the method is promising and allows to reconstruct the state accurately despite attacks. Finally, we consider the problem of designing output-feedback controllers that stabilize the system despite sensor attacks. We show that a principle of separation between estimation and control holds and that the design of resilient output feedback controllers can be reduced to the design of resilient state estimators. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",Algorithm; feedback controller,Algorithms; Closed loop control systems; Design; Embedded systems; Linear systems; Nonlinear control systems; Sensors; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Feedback control loops; Feedback controller; Local control; Output feedback controller; Output-feedback controllers; Sensors or actuators; State Estimators; Feedback control,,,,,"Cardenas, A., Challenges for securing cyber physical systems (2009) Workshop Future Directions Cyber-Phys.

Currently deployed ZIA solutions are predominantly based on the terminal detecting the proximity of the user's personal device, or a security token, by running an authentication protocol over a short-range wireless communication channel. Unfortunately, this simple approach is highly vulnerable to low-cost and practical relay attacks which completely offset the usability benefits of ZIA. The use of contextual information, gathered via on-board sensors, to detect the co-presence of the user and the verifier is a recently proposed mechanism to resist relay attacks. In this paper, we systematically investigate the performance of different sensor modalities for co-presence detection with respect to a standard Dolev-Yao adversary. First, using a common data collection framework run in realistic everyday settings, we compare the performance of four commonly available sensor modalities (WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, and Audio) in resisting ZIA relay attacks, and find that WiFi is better than the rest. Second, we show that, compared to any single modality, fusing multiple modalities improves resilience against ZIA relay attacks while retaining a high level of usability. Third, we motivate the need for a stronger adversarial model to characterize an attacker who can compromise the integrity of context sensing itself. We show that in the presence of such a powerful attacker, each individual sensor modality offers very low security. Positively, the use of multiple sensor modalities improves security against such an attacker if the attacker cannot compromise multiple modalities simultaneously. © 2014 IEEE.",,Sensors; Ubiquitous computing; Authentication protocols; Contextual information; Dolev-Yao adversary; Multiple modalities; Multiple sensors; On-board sensors; Personal devices; Short-range wireless communications; Authentication,,,,,"Brands, S., Chaum, D., Distance-bounding protocols (1994) Workshopon the Theory and Application of Cryptographic Techniques on Advancesin Cryptology, EUROCRYPT '93, pp. 344-359. , Springer-Verlag NewYork, Inc; Corner, M.D., Noble, B.D., Zero-interaction authentication (2002) Proc. 8th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing Andnetworking MobiCom '02, pp. 1-11. , New York, NY, USA, ACM; Czeskis, A., Dietz, M., Kohno, T., Wallach, D., Balfanz, D., Strengtheninguser authentication through opportunistic cryptographic identityassertions (2012) Proc. 2012 ACM Conference on Computer and Communicationssecurity, CCS '12, pp. 404-414. , New York, NY, USA, ACM; Czeskis, A., Koscher, K., Smith, J.R., Kohno, T., RFIDs and secret handshakes: Defending against ghost-and-leech attacks and unauthorized reads with context-aware communications (2008) Proc.15th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, CCS'08, pp. 479-490. , New York, NY, USA, ACM; Dolev, D., Yao, A.C.-C., On the security of public key protocols (1983) IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 29 (2), pp. 198-207; Dousse, O., Eberle, J., Mertens, M., Place learning via direct WiFifingerprint clustering (2012) 2012 IEEE 13th International Conference OnMobile Data Management, 0, pp. 282-287; Francillon, A., Danev, B., Čapkun, S., Relay attacks on passivekeyless entry and start systems in modern cars (2011) Proc.

Nevertheless, little attention has been directed toward the performance gain of network coding versus traditional routing in adversarial wireless mesh networks. To address this critical issue, in this paper, we formally model and analyze the impact of pollution attacks on traditional routing and network coding in both unicast and multicast scenarios. With the combination of both numerical and simulation studies, we evaluate the performance of traditional routing and network coding in adversarial wireless networks. Our data is consistent with the theoretical findings. Our results show that network coding is not absolutely better than traditional routing and its performance gain largely depends on various factors. Most importantly, given a network, the threshold of these factors can be derived from numerical solutions given by our developed closed-form formulae. Thus, we can determine whether network coding should be used in the network. Our results contribute to the foundation, providing guidelines for designing and applying network coding into hostile wireless networks. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A flow network is modeled by a potential function defined over the nodes and a flow function defined over arcs (links). In particular, the difference in potential function between two nodes is characterized by a nonlinear flux function of the flow on link between the two nodes. To assess the vulnerability of the network to adversarial attack, the problem is formulated as an attacker-defender network interdiction model. The attacker's objective is to interdict the most valuable links of the network given his resource constraints. The defender's objective is to minimize power loss and the unmet demand in the network. A bi-level approach is explored to identify most critical links for network interdiction. The applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a reference water distribution network, and its utility toward developing mitigation plans is discussed.

Universidad 30, 28911 Leganés, Madrid, Spain","When compared to signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), anomaly detectors present the potential advantage of detecting previously unseen attacks, which makes them an attractive solution against zero-day exploits and other attacks for which a signature is unavailable. Most anomaly detectors rely on machine learning algorithms to derive a model of normality that is later used to detect suspicious events. Such algorithms, however, are generally susceptible to evasion by means of carefully constructed attacks that are not recognized as anomalous. Different strategies to thwart evasion have been proposed over the last years, including the use of randomization to make somewhat uncertain how each packet will be processed. In this paper we analyze the strength of the randomization strategy suggested for Anagram, a well-known anomaly detector based on n-gram models. We show that an adversary who can interact with the system for a short period of time with inputs of his choosing will be able to recover the secret mask used to process packets. We describe and discuss an efficient algorithm to do this and report our experiences with a prototype implementation. Furthermore, we show that the specific form of randomization suggested for Anagram is a double-edged sword, as knowledge of the mask makes evasion easier than in the non-randomized case. We finally discuss a simple countermeasure to prevent our attacks. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Adversarial classification; Anomaly detection; Evasion attacks; Intrusion detection systems; Keywords,Computer crime; Learning algorithms; Adversarial classifications; Anomaly detection; Evasion attacks; Intrusion Detection Systems; Keywords; Random processes,,,,,"Ariu, D., Tronci, R., Giacinto, G., HMMPayl an intrusion detection system based on hidden Markov models (2011) Comput Secur, 30, pp. 221-241; Aziz, A., Salama, M., Ella Hassanien, A., El-Ola Hanafi, S., Detectors generation using genetic algorithm for a negative selection inspired anomaly network intrusion detection system (2012) 2012 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS), pp. 597-602; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., Can machine learning be secure?

However, in addition to several problems with TBC, it has become increasingly difficult to solve in recent years, to keep up with OCR technologies. Imagebased CAPTCHA (IBC), on the other hand, is a relatively new concept that promises to overcome key limitations of TBC. In this paper we present an innovative IBC, Deep- CAPTCHA, based on design guidelines, psychological theory and empirical experiments. DeepCAPTCHA exploits the human ability of depth preception. In our IBC users should arrange 3D objects in terms of size (or depth). In our framework for DeepCAPTCHA, we automatically mine 3D models, and use a human-machine Merge Sort algorithm to order these unknown objects. We then create new appearances for these objects at multiplication factor of 200, and present these new images to the end-users for sorting (as CAPTCHA tasks). Humans are able to apply their rapid and reliable object recognition and comparison (arise from years experience with the physical environment) to solve DeepCAPTCHA, while machines are still unable to complete these tasks. Experimental results show that humans can solve DeepCAPTCHA with a high accuracy (∼ 84%) and ease, while machines perform dismally.

However, there are many security issues in protecting location information, which can easily be abused by attackers. Location based adversarial activities affect the operation and performance of geographical routing protocols. There are only a few works on the literature that studied the impact of location based attacks on geographical routing. This work analyzes the impact of malicious nodes on the GPSR performance associated with fake location. This proposal identifies a set of possible location based attacks and analyzes the local problems that arise from the location based adversarial activities. Finally, it demonstrates the overall impact on the routing performance, by simulating the network in various attack scenarios. This study illustrates the effect of the adversarial activities with respect to the packet delivery ratio, overhead, average end-to-end delay, routing loops, packet dropping probability, and location error rate. The simulation results concluded that the overall routing performance degrades, depending on the type and percentage of adversaries. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

Tullock, however, argues that the common law is inefficient and suggests dramatic modifications to the American legal system, transforming it from a common law system to a civil code system and abandoning the adversarial proceedings in favor of an inquisitorial process. This essay summarizes and critically evaluates the thrusts of Tullock's 1988 article and his 1997 book, which, together direct a full-frontal attack on the Anglo-Saxon common law system. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",American rule; Efficiency of the common law hypothesis; English rule; Gordon Tullock; Law-and-economics,,,,,,"Buchanan, J.M., The qualities of a natural economist (1987) Democracy and Public Choice: Essays in Honor of Gordon Tullock, pp. 9-19. , C.
