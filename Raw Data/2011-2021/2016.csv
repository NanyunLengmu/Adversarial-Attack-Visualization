We treat adversaries as omniscient and impose no restrictions (statistical or otherwise) on how they can alter the measurements of the sensors under attack. Given a bound on the number of attacked sensors, and under a certain observability condition, we show that we can construct models that are useful for certain control purposes, e.g., stabilization. We also provide a precise characterization of the equivalence relation that identifies which models cannot be distinguished in the presence of attacks. © 2016 IEEE.",,,,,,,"Greenberg, A., (2015) Hackers Remotely Kill A Jeep on the Highway, with Me in It, , http//www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotelykill-jeep-highway; Langner, R., Stuxnet: Dissecting a cyberwarfare weapon (2011) IEEE Security & Privacy, 9 (3), pp. 49-51; Cárdenas, A.A., Amin, S., Sastry, S., Research challenges for the security of control systems (2008) HotSec; Sundaram, S., Pajic, M., Hadjicostis, C.N., Mangharam, R., Pappas, G.J., The wireless control network: Monitoring for malicious behavior (2010) 49th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC), pp. 5979-5984; Amin, S., Schwartz, G.A., Hussain, A., Quest of benchmarking security risks to cyber-physical systems (2013) IEEE Network, 27 (1), pp. 19-24; Mo, Y., Kim, T.H.-J., Brancik, K., Dickinson, D., Lee, H., Perrig, A., Sinopoli, B., Cyber-physical security of a smart grid infrastructure (2012) Proceedings of the IEEE, 100 (1), pp. 195-209; Fawzi, H., Tabuada, P., Diggavi, S., Secure estimation and control for cyber-physical systems under adversarial attacks (2014) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 59 (6), pp. 1454-1467; Mo, Y., Garone, E., Casavola, A., Sinopoli, B., False data injection attacks against state estimation in wireless sensor networks (2010) 49th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC), pp. 5967-5972; Teixeira, A., Sou, K.C., Sandberg, H., Johansson, K.H., Secure control systems: A quantitative risk management approach (2015) IEEE Control Systems Magazine, 35 (1), pp. 24-45; Mo, Y., Hespanha, J.P., Sinopoli, B., Resilient detection in the presence of integrity attacks (2014) IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 62 (1), pp. 31-43; Pasqualetti, F., Dorfler, F., Bullo, F., Attack detection and identification in cyber-physical systems (2013) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 58 (11), pp. 2715-2729; Antsaklis, P.J., Michel, A.N., Linear systems (2006) Springer Science & Business Media; Showkatbakhsh, M., Tabuada, P., Diggavi, S., System identification in the presence of adversarial outputs Technical Report UCLA-CyPhyLab-2016-01, 2016.

We develop a secure distributed estimation strategy subject to an f-locally bounded Byzantine adversary model, where a compromised node can arbitrarily deviate from the rules of any prescribed algorithm. Under such a threat model, we provide sufficient conditions guaranteeing the success of our estimation strategy. Our method relies on the construction of a subgraph, which we call a Mode Estimation Directed Acyclic Graph (MEDAG), for each unstable and marginally stable eigenvalue of the plant. We provide a distributed algorithm for constructing a MEDAG and characterize graph topologies for which the construction algorithm is guaranteed to succeed.

CPS security, though well studied, suffers from fragmentation. In this paper, we consider control systems as an abstraction of CPS. Here, we use information flow analysis, a well established set of methods developed in software security, to obtain a unified framework that captures and extends results in control system security. Specifically, we propose the Kullback Liebler (KL) divergence as a causal measure of information flow, which quantifies the effect of adversarial inputs on sensor outputs. We show that the proposed measure characterizes the resilience of control systems to specific attack strategies by relating the KL divergence to optimal detection. We then relate information flows to stealthy attack scenarios where an adversary can bypass detection. Finally, this article examines active detection mechanisms where a defender intelligently manipulates control inputs or the system itself to elicit information flows from an attacker's malicious behavior. In all previous cases, we demonstrate an ability to investigate and extend existing results through the proposed information flow analyses. © 2016 IEEE.",,,,,,,"Cardenas, T., Roosta, A.A., Sastry, S., Rethinking security properties, threat models, and the design space in sensor networks: A case study in scada systems (2009) Ad Hoc Networks, 7 (8), pp. 1434-1447; Langner, R., To kill a centrifuge: A technical analysis of what stuxnet's creators tried to achieve (2013) Langner Communications, , www.langner.com/en/wpcontent/uploads/2013/11/To-kill-a-centrifuge.pdf, Tech.

Specifically, we design a decentralized algorithm that aims to maximize the algebraic connectivity of the global network iteratively. In addition, we show that the designed algorithm converges to a Nash equilibrium asymptotically and yields an equilibrium network. To study the network resiliency, we introduce three adversarial attack models and characterize their worst-case impacts on the network performance.

It states that at least two separate entities must approve a message before it is considered authentic. Hence, an adversarial party aiming to forge bogus content is forced to convince other parties to collude in the attack. We present a formal framework along with a suitable security model. Namely, a party sets a policy for a given message which involves multiple additional approvers in order to authenticate the message. Finally, we show how these signatures are black-box realized by secure sanitizable signature schemes. © 2016 IEEE.",,Access control; Black boxes; Formal framework; Security model; Signature Scheme; Network security,,,,,"Ahn, J.H., Boneh, D., Camenisch, J., Hohenberger, S., Shelat, A., Waters, B., (2011) Computing on Authenticated Data, , http://eprint.iacr.org/, Cryptology ePrint Archive, Report 2011/096; Asokan, N., Shoup, V., Waidner, M., Optimistic fair exchange of digital signatures (extended abstract) (1998) EuroCrypt, pp. 591-606; Ateniese, G., Chou, D.H., De Medeiros, B., Tsudik, G., Sanitizable signatures (2005) ESORICS, pp. 159-177; Baum-Waidner, B., Waidner, M., Round-optimal and abuse free optimistic multi-party contract signing (2000) ICALP, pp. 524-535; Bellare, M., Neven, G., Multi-signatures in the plain public-key model and a general forking lemma (2006) CCS, pp. 390-399; Boldyreva, A., Threshold signatures, multisignatures and blind signatures based on the gap-diffie-hellman-group signature scheme (2003) PKC 2003, pp. 31-46; Boneh, D., Gentry, C., Lynn, B., Shacham, H., Aggregate and verifiably encrypted signatures from bilinear maps (2003) EUROCRYPT, pp. 416-432; Brzuska, C., Fischlin, M., Freudenreich, T., Lehmann, A., Page, M., Schelbert, J., Schröder, D., Volk, F., Security of sanitizable signatures revisited (2009) Proc. of PKC 2009, pp. 317-336. , Springer; Brzuska, C., Fischlin, M., Lehmann, A., Schröder, D., Sanitizable signatures: How to partially delegate control for authenticated data (2009) Proc. of BIOSIG, Volume 155 of LNI, pp. 117-128. , GI; Brzuska, C., Fischlin, M., Lehmann, A., Schröder, D., Unlinkability of sanitizable signatures (2010) PKC, pp. 444-461; Brzuska, C., Pöhls, H.C., Samelin, K., Non-interactive public accountability for sanitizable signatures (2012) EuroPKI, pp. 178-193; Brzuska, C., Pöhls, H.C., Samelin, K., Efficient and perfectly unlinkable sanitizable signatures without group signatures (2013) EuroPKI, pp. 12-30; Canard, S., Jambert, A., On extended sanitizable signature schemes (2010) CT-RSA, pp. 179-194; Canard, S., Jambert, A., Lescuyer, R., Sanitizable signatures with several signers and sanitizers (2012) AFRICACRYPT, pp. 35-52; Canard, S., Laguillaumie, F., Milhau, M., Trapdoor sanitizable signatures and their application to content protection (2008) ACNS, pp. 258-276; Canard, S., Lescuyer, R., Protecting privacy by sanitizing personal data: A new approach to anonymous credentials (2013) ASIACCS, pp. 381-392; De Meer, H., Pöhls, H.C., Posegga, J., Samelin, K., Scope of security properties of sanitizable signatures revisited (2013) ARES, pp. 188-197; De Meer, H., Pöhls, H.C., Posegga, J., Samelin, K., On the relation between redactable and sanitizable signature schemes (2014) ESSoS, pp. 113-130; Demirel, D., Derler, D., Hanser, C., Pöhls, H.C., Slamanig, D., Traverso, G., (2015) PRISMACLOUD D4.4: Overview of Functional and Malleable Signature Schemes, , www.prismacloud.eu, Technical report, H2020; Derler, D., Pöhls, H.C., Samelin, K., Slamanig, D., A general framework for redactable signatures and new constructions (2015) ICISC, pp. 3-19; Derler, D., Slamanig, D., Rethinking privacy for extended sanitizable signatures and a black-box construction of strongly private schemes (2015) ProvSec, pp. 455-474; Fehr, V., Fischlin, M., (2015) Sanitizable Signcryption: Sanitization over Encrypted Data (full Version), , http://eprint.iacr.org/, Cryptology ePrint Archive, Report 2015/765; Ghosh, E., Ohrimenko, O., Tamassia, R., Verifiable member and order queries on a list in zero-knowledge (2014) EPrint, 632; Gong, J., Qian, H., Zhou, Y., Fully-secure and practical sanitizable signatures (2011) InsCrypt, 6584, pp. 300-317; Klonowski, M., Lauks, A., Extended sanitizable signatures (2006) ICISC, pp. 343-355; Krenn, S., Samelin, K., Sommer, D., Stronger security for sanitizable signatures (2015) DPM, pp. 100-117; Mambo, M., Usuda, K., Okamoto, E., Proxy signatures for delegating signing operation (1996) CCS '96, pp. 48-57; Pöhls, H.C., Peters, S., Samelin, K., Posegga, J., De Meer, H., Malleable signatures for resource constrained platforms (2013) WISTP, pp. 18-33; Pöhls, H.C., Samelin, K., Accountable redactable signatures (2015) ARES, pp. 60-69; Pöhls, H.C., Samelin, K., Posegga, J., Sanitizable signatures in XML signature - Performance, mixing properties, and revisiting the property of transparency (2011) ACNS, Volume 6715 of LNCS, pp. 166-182. , Springer; Shoup, V., Practical threshold signatures (2000) EuroCrypt, pp. 207-220; Yum, D.H., Seo, J.W., Lee, P.J., Trapdoor sanitizable signatures made easy (2010) ACNS, pp. 53-68",,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"11th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security, ARES 2016",31 August 2016 through 2 September 2016,,126391,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

Swarm robotics have a large number of potential uses, including applications in the military, monitoring, disaster relief, healthcare and commercial applications. To be able to achieve their goals, it is of utmost importance that communications between agents are secure in the presence of possibly malicious interruptions and attacks from adversaries. The authors will discuss the issues surrounding the provision of secure communications in swarm robotics: what secure communications mean, how the characteristics of swarm robotics present a security challenge, the relationship between security issues for swarm robotics and other network technologies, and how different adversarial models demand different types of solutions. It will then be discussed what the important open research questions are in secure communications in swarm robotics. © 2017 by IGI Global.

For a security officer, simulating and analysing such attacks would provide useful insights towards possible countermeasures. We propose the notion of influence tokens, which a social engineer can exploit to change human behaviour. We model the relationship between agents and a social engineer using Coloured Petri Nets, which govern the behaviour of influence tokens. We then illustrate our results showing how influence tokens propagate, impact and alters a Social Engineers success rate in a tailgating scenario. In particular, we show that a specific combination of tokens will increase the adversaries success rate, whereas, investing in a different set of tokens yields no further rewards for the adversary. © 2016 ACM.",,Engineers; Petri nets; Professional aspects; Security of data; Social sciences; Behaviour changes; Coloured Petri Nets; Human behaviours; Security officers; Behavioral research,,,,,"Bella, G., Coles-Kemp, L., Layered analysis of security ceremonies (2012) IFIP International Information Security Conference, pp. 273-286. , Springer; Bezuidenhout, M., Mouton, F., Venter, H.S., Social engineering attack detection model: Seadm (2010) 2010 Information Security for South Africa, pp. 1-8. , IEEE; Bullee, J.-W.H., Montoya, L., Pieters, W., Junger, M., Hartel, P.H., The persuasion and security awareness experiment: Reducing the success of social engineering attacks (2015) Journal of Experimental Criminology, 11 (1), pp. 97-115; Cialdini, R.B., Garde, N., (1987) Inuence.

In order to protect their investment from potential attacks such as illegal copying, tampering, and malicious reverse engineering, most companies utilize some type of protection software, also known as obfuscators, to create variants of their products that are more resilient to adversarial analysis. In this paper, we report on the effectiveness of different commercial obfuscators against traditional man-at-the-end (MATE) attacks where an adversary can utilize tools such as debuggers, disassemblers, and de-compilers as a legitimate end-user of a binary executable. Our case study includes four benchmark programs that have associated adversarial goals categorized as either comprehension or change tasks. We use traditional static and dynamic analysis techniques to identify the adversarial workload and outcomes before and after each program is transformed by a set of three commercial obfuscators. Our results confirm what is typically assumed: an adversary with a reasonable background in the computing disciplines can both comprehend and make changes to any of our completely unprotected programs using standard tools. Additionally, given the same skill set and attack approach, protected programs can still be probed to leak certain information, but none could be successfully altered and saved to create a cracked version. As a contribution, our methodology is unique compared to prior studies on obfuscation effectiveness in that we categorize adversarial skill and delineate program goals into comprehension and change ability, while considering the load time and overhead of obfuscated variants. © 2016 ACM.",Anti-tamper; Commercial obfuscators; Cracked programs; Dynamic analysis; Malicious reverse engineering; Manat-the-end (MATE) attacks; Obfuscation; Software protection; Static analysis,Cracks; Dynamic analysis; Reverse engineering; Static analysis; Technical presentations; Anti-tamper; Commercial obfuscators; Manat-the-end (MATE) attacks; Obfuscation; Software protection; Program debugging,,,,,"(2013) Defending Against the Triple Threat to Intellectual Property, , http://www.safenet-inc.com/resource/Resources7Detail.aspx?cat=srm&sc=341, Anon, Retrieved June 15, 2015; (2014) The Compliance Gap, , http://globalstudy.bsa.org/2013, Anon, Retrieved June 28, 2015; Akhunzada, A., Sookah, M., Anuar, N.B., Gani, A., Ahmed, E., Shiraz, M., Furnell, S., Khan, M.K., Man-At-The-End attacks: Analysis, taxonomy, human aspects, motivation and future directions (2015) Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 48, pp. 44-57; Pressman, R., (2005) Software Engineering, , Boston, Mass.: McGraw-Hill; Kotonya, G., Sommerville, I., (1998) Requirements Engineering, , Chichester: J.

From the security perspective, this opens collaborative deep learning to poisoning attacks, wherein adversarial users deliberately alter their inputs to mis-train the model. These attacks are known for machine learning systems in general, but their impact on new deep learning systems is not well-established. We investigate the setting of indirect collaborative deep learning - a form of practical deep learning wherein users submit masked features rather than direct data. Indirect collaborative deep learning is preferred over direct, because it distributes the cost of computation and can be made privacy-preserving. In this paper, we study the susceptibility of collaborative deep learning systems to adversarial poisoning attacks. Specifically, we obtain the following empirical results on 2 popular datasets for handwritten images (MNIST) and traffic signs (GTSRB) used in auto-driving cars. For collaborative deep learning systems, we demonstrate that the attacks have 99% success rate for misclassifying specific target data while poisoning only 10% of the entire training dataset. As a defense, we propose AUROR, a system that detects malicious users and generates an accurate model. The accuracy under the deployed defense on practical datasets is nearly unchanged when operating in the absence of attacks. The accuracy of a model trained using AUROR drops by only 3% even when 30% of all the users are adversarial. AUROR provides a strong guarantee against evasion; if the attacker tries to evade, its attack effectiveness is bounded. © 2016 ACM.",,Data privacy; Network security; Security of data; Security systems; Traffic signs; Accurate modeling; Collaborative settings; Deep learning; Handwritten images; Poisoning attacks; Privacy preserving; Training dataset; Learning systems,,,,,"Batman, V., Superman Caught Purchasing Fake Ratings on IMDB, , http://www.bleachbypass.com/batman-v-superman-fake-imdb-ratings/; Facebook's Moments App Uses Artifical Intelligence, , http://money.cnn.com/2015/06/15/technology/facebook-moments-ai/; M' Is Super Smart.

The storage system must be secured against passive and active types of attacks for efficient protection of the stored data. The aim is achieving satisfactory level of security of the storage system and at the same time maintaining the desired level of reliability, which arises when there are node failures. In our work we apply this concept in a Twin-code framework, in presence of an intruder who can observe and modify the stored data on the networks nodes. We are making a new code construction, which is simultaneously secure against passive and active attacks and at the same time satisfies particular bound for reliability. Moreover, for this construction we are proving the level of security under the above mentioned constraints. © 2016 IEEE.",Active attack; distributed storage system (DSS); information-theoretic secrecy; passive attack; security; twin-code framework,Codes (symbols); Control systems; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Information theory; Multiprocessing systems; Reliability; Routers; Active attack; Code frameworks; Distributed storage system; information-theoretic secrecy; Passive attacks; security; Network security,,,,,"James, T., (2011) IBMs Big Data Platform and Decision Management, , http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/bigdata/, May [Online]; Huang, C., Simitci, H., Xu, Y., Ogus, A., Calder, B., Gopalan, P., Li, J., Yekhanin, S., Erasure coding in windows azure storage (2012) Proc. of USENIX ATC, , Jun; Rashmi, K.V., Shah, N.B., Kumar, P.V., Enabling node repair in any erasure code for distributed storage (2011) Proc.

This crypto primitive is quite useful in designing denial of service attack-resilient protocols. To our knowledge, prior DRE constructions are considered in the traditional PKE settings, which may face the difficulty of certificate management. This paper aiming at solving this dilemma of DRE in the traditional PKE settings, and gives an identity-based variant version of DRE: identity-based dual receiver encryption (ID-DRE) that combines the notion of DRE and identity-based encryption (IBE). Based on Waters' IBE (Crypto'05), two ID-DRE schemes are constructed in the standard model and by partitioning methodology, provable security of our ID-DRE schemes are obtained under the decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman. Furthermore, we achieve a tighter reduction by adopting a random walk-like methodology of analysis on the lower bound of simulators' artificial abort, which also results in better security tightness for Waters IBE. This improved result O(√n.q) for Waters' IBE, where n is the bitlength of messages and q is the number of adversarial key queries, is consistent with Hofheinz and Kiltz's result (Crypto'08).

Counterexamples cannot be deduced directly if a protocol is proved insecure by strand space model. Based on backward reasoning and strand space model, an attack analysis method is proposed to find all possible attacks that cause nonexistent routes to be accepted. To begin with, a nonexistent route is assumed to be accepted by a routing protocol. Then, to decrease the complexity of analysis, an adversarial node abstraction process is carried out to make all the intermediate nodes in the nonexistent route turn into normal nodes. Furthermore, a combined analysis of strand space model and cross-route attack is carried on the route reply phase of the routing protocol. Finally, all possible attacks that lead to the nonexistent route can be deduced after combined analyzing of the route request phase. Then, we take endairA—a classic secure routing protocol in ad hoc networks—as an example to verify the correctness and effectiveness of the new method. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Ad-hoc assemblages of communication technology have the potential to bridge such breakdowns. This article investigates the use of an ad-hoc system for sending SOS signals in a large-scale exercise that simulated a terrorist attack. In this context, we found that the sensitivity that was introduced by the adversarial nature of the situation posed unexpected challenges for our approach, as giving away one's location in the immediate danger of a terrorist attack became an issue both for first responders and the affected people in the area. We show how practices of calling for help and reacting to help calls can be affected by such a system and affect the management of the visibility and validity of SOS calls, implying a need for further negotiation in situations where communication is sensitive and technically restrained. © 2016 ACM.",Emergency response; Mobile computing; SOS calls; Validity; Visibility,Mobile computing; Systems engineering; Visibility; Ad hoc systems; Communication technologies; Distress call; Emergency response; First responders; SOS calls; Terrorist attacks; Validity; Terrorism,,,,,"Abel, F., Hauff, C., Houben, G.J., Stronkman, R., Tao, K., Twitcident: Fighting fire with information from social web streams (2012) Proceedings of the 21st International Conference Companion on World Wide Web (WWW'12 Companion), pp. 305-308. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2187980.2188035, ACM, New York, NY; Aguirre, B., Wenger, D., Glass, T., Diaz-Murillo, M., Vigo, G., The social organization of search and rescue: Evidence from the Guadalajara gasoline explosion (1995) International Journal of Mass Emergencies and Disasters, 13, pp. 93-106. , 1995; Al-Akkad, A., Raffelsberger, C., Boden, A., Ramirez, L., Zimmermann, A., Tweeting when online is off""?

However, model checking the design or testing the simulator-based prototype of a protocol does not guarantee that the implementation is free of bugs and vulnerabilities. Testing implementations beyond their basic functionality (also known as adversarial testing) can increase protocol robustness. We focus on automated adversarial testing of real-world implementations of wireless routing protocols. In our previous work we created Turret, a platform that uses a network emulator and virtualization to test unmodified binaries of general distributed systems. Based on Turret, we create Turret-W designed specifically for wireless routing protocols. Turret-W includes new functionalities such as differentiating routing messages from data messages to enable evaluation of attacks on the control plane and the data plane separately, support for several additional protocols (e.g., those that use homogeneous/heterogenous packet formats, those that run on geographic forwarding (not just IP), those that operate at the data link layer instead of the network layer), support for several additional attacks (e.g., replay attacks) and for establishment of adversarial side-channels that allow for collusion. Turret-W can test not only general routing attacks, but also wireless specific attacks such as wormhole. Using Turret-W on publicly available implementations of five representative routing protocols, we (re-)discovered 37 attacks and 3 bugs. All these bugs and 5 of the total attacks were not previously reported to the best of our knowledge. © 1993-2012 IEEE.",Automatic testing; routing protocols; security; wireless communication,Internet protocols; Model checking; Network layers; Routing protocols; Telecommunication networks; Additional Protocol; Distributed systems; Geographic forwarding; Network emulators; Real-world implementation; Virtualizations; Wireless routing; Wireless routing protocols; Side channel attack,,,,,"Hoque, E., Lee, H., Potharaju, R., Killian, C., Nita-Rotaru, C., Adversarial testing of wireless routing implementations (2013) Proc.

For various IP applications including VoIP, the topic of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has attracted major concern from researchers. SIP is an advanced signaling protocol operating on Internet Telephony. SIP uses digest authentication protocols such as Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) and Hyper Text Transport Protocol (HTTP). When a user seeks SIP services, authentication plays an important role in providing secure access to the server only to the authorized access seekers. Being an insecure-channel-based protocol, a SIP authentication protocol is susceptible to adversarial threats. Therefore, security is a big concern in SIP authentication mechanisms. This paper reveals the security vulnerabilities of two recently proposed SIP authentication schemes for VoIP, Irshad et al.’s scheme [Multimed. Tools. Appl. doi:10.1007/s11042-013-1807-z] and Arshad and Nikooghadam’s scheme [Multimed. Tools. Appl. DOI 10.1007/s11042-014-2282-x], the later scheme is based on the former scheme. Irshad et al.’s scheme suffers from password guessing, user impersonation and server spoofing attacks. Arshad and Nikooghadam’s scheme can be threatened with server spoofing and stolen verifier attack. None of these two schemes achieve mutual authentication. It also fails to follow the single round-trip authentication design of Irshad et al.’s scheme. To overcome these weaknesses, we propose a provable secure single round-trip SIP authentication scheme for VoIP using smart card. We formally prove the security of the scheme in random oracle and demonstrate through discussion its resistance to various attacks. The comparative analysis shows that the proposed SIP authentication scheme offers superior performance with a little extra computational cost. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Authentication; Provable security; Session initiation protocol; Smart card; Voice over internet protocol,Aluminum; Authentication; Cryptography; HTTP; Hypertext systems; Internet; Internet telephony; Security of data; Smart cards; Transportation; Voice/data communication systems; Authentication mechanisms; Authentication protocols; Provable security; Security vulnerabilities; Server-spoofing attacks; Session initiation protocol; Session Initiation Protocols; Voice over Internet protocol; Internet protocols,,,,,"Abdalla, M., Pointcheval, D., Interactive Diffie-Hellman assumptions with applications to password-based authentication (2005) Proceedings of FC’05, LNCS, 3570, pp. 341-356; Arshad, R., Ikram, N., Elliptic curve cryptography based mutual authentication scheme for session initiation protocol (2013) Multimed Tools Appl, 66 (2), pp. 165-178; Arshad, H., Nikooghadam, M., An efficient and secure authentication and key agreement scheme for session initiation protocol using ECC (2014) Multimed Tools Appl; Branovic, I., Giorgi, R., Martinelli, E., A workload characterization of elliptic curve cryptography methods in embedded environments (2004) ACM SIGARCH Comput Archit News, 32 (3), pp. 27-34; Canetti, R., Krawczyk, H., Analysis of key-exchange protocols and their use for building secure channels (2001) Proc.

This paper takes the first steps toward addressing this need. Here, we introduce a framework that allows for modeling of ICS systems with highly interconnected components and study this model through the lens of lattice theory. We then turn our attention to the problem of determining the optimal/most dangerous for a cyber-Adversary with respect to this model and find it to be an NP-Complete problem. To address this complexity, we utilize an A∗-based approach and develop admissible heuristics. We provide an implementation and show through a suite of experiments using both simulated and actual vulnerability data that this method performs well in practice for identifying adversarial courses of action in this domain. © 2016 IEEE.",Adversarial modeling; Cybersecurity,Big data; Computational complexity; Computer crime; Control systems; Information science; Lattice theory; Malware; Complex nature; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Industrial control systems; Potential threats; Show through; Through the lens; Intelligent control,,,,,"Shakarian, P., Shakarian, J., Considerations for the development of threat prediction in the cyber domain (2016) AAAI-16 Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Cyber Security; Shakarian, P., Stuxnet: Cyberwar revolution in military affairs (2011) Small Wars Journal, , April; Falliere, N., Murchu, L.O., Chien, E., W32.

Due to potential denial of service attacks, the distributions of link states could be stochastic (benign or i.i.d.), contaminated or adversarial (non-i.i.d.) at different temporal and spatial locations. Without any a priori, designing an adaptive SPR protocol to cope with all possible situations in practice optimally is a very challenging issue. In this paper, we present the first solution by formulating it as a multi-armed bandit problem. By introducing novel control parameters to explore link conditions, our proposed algorithms could automatically detect features of the environment within a unified framework and find the optimal SPR strategies with almost optimal learning performance in all possible cases over time. Moreover, we study important issues related to the practical implementation, such as decoupling route selection with multi-path route probing, cooperative learning among multiple sources, the cold-start issue and delayed feedback of our algorithm. Nonetheless, the proposed SPR algorithms can be implemented with low complexity and they are proved to scale very well with the network size.

Nevertheless, no adequate method exists to quantify the deterrent effects of counterterrorism security systems (CTSSs). Game-theoretic analyses of terrorism risk typically limit solutions to expected payoffs (EPs). This restricts the defender's ability to consider the full scope of outcomes and renders her vulnerable to the flaw of averages. The probabilistic game-theoretic method (PGTM) is developed as an extension of game theory (GT) to explicitly account for uncertainties and remove the limitations of traditional decision-making based solely on EPs. The problem of selecting robust optimal CTSSs under uncertainty is modeled as a Bayesian sequential defender–attacker game pictured in the form a hybrid decision-game tree. The analysis uses Monte Carlo simulation and the results are reported as risk curves. The deterrent effects of CTSSs are endogenously determined. PGTM is applied to the problem of selecting an optimal CTSS for a small boat attack. The results demonstrate that PGTM can result in superior strategies than traditional GT that consider solely EPs and traditional probabilistic risk analyses of terrorism risk that do not account for deterrent effects because they do not endogenously model defender–attacker interactions. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adversarial behavior; counterterrorism security system; deterrence; game theory; probabilistic game-theoretic method, Bayesian sequential defender–attacker game; terrorism risk analysis",Decision making; Decision theory; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Optimization; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Security systems; Terrorism; Trees (mathematics); Adversarial behavior; Bayesian; Counter terrorism; Deterrence; Terrorism risks; Game theory,,,,,"Aven, T., Guikema, S., On the concept and definition of terrorism risk (2015) Risk Anal, 35 (12), pp. 2162-2171; Banks, D.L., Rios, J., Ríos Insua, D., (2016) Adversarial risk analysis, , CRC Press, Boca Raton; Bier, V.M., Azaiez, M.N., (2009) Game theoretic risk analysis of security threats, , Springer, New York; Brown, G.G., Cox, L.A., Jr., How probabilistic risk assessment can mislead terrorism analysts (2011) Risk Anal, 31 (2), pp. 196-204; Brown, G.G., Cox, L.A., Jr., Making terrorism risk analysis less harmful and more useful: Another try (2011) Risk Anal, 31 (2), pp. 193-195; Cameron, A.C., Trivedi, P.K., (2005) Microeconometrics: methods and applications, , Cambridge University Press, New York; Dixit, A.K., Nalebuff, B.J., (2008) The art of strategy: A game theorist's guide to success in business and life, , W.W.

Most of the proposals for their detection suggested recognition methods based on the comparison of use models of the protected environment. However recent studies have shown their vulnerability against adversarial attacks based on imitating the behavior of legitimate users. In order to contribute to their identification, this article introduces a novel detection method robust against evasion strategies based on mimicry. The proposal described two levels of information processing: analysis and verification. At the analysis stage, local alignment algorithms are implemented. In this way it is possible to score the similarity between action sequences performed by users, bearing in mind their regions of greatest resemblance. On the other hand, a novel validation scheme based on the statistical non-parametric U-test is implemented. Through this it is possible to refine the labeling of sequences to avoid making hasty decisions when their nature is not sufficiently clear. In order to strengthen their effectiveness against mimicry attacks, the analysis of the monitored sequences is performed in concurrency. This involves partitioning long sequences with two purposes: making subsequences of small intrusions more visible and analyzing new sequences when suspicious situations occur, such as the execution of never before seen commands or the discovery of potentially harmful activities. The proposal has been evaluated from the functional standard SEA and mimicry attacks. Promising experimental results have been shown, demonstrating great precision against conventional masqueraders (TPR=98.3%, FPR=0.77%) and a success rate of 80.2% when identifying mimicry attacks, hence outperforming the best contributions of bibliography. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Adversarial attacks; Identity theft; Information security; Intrusion detection; Masquerade attacks,Security of data; Adversarial attacks; Analysis and verifications; Detection methods; Evasion strategy; Identity theft; Masquerade attacks; Masquerade detection; Recognition methods; Intrusion detection,,,,,"Agrafiotis, I., Nurse, J.R., Buckley, O., Legg, P., Creese, S., Goldsmith, M., Identifying attack patterns for insider threat detection (2015) Computer Fraud & Security, 2015, pp. 9-17; Ahmed, A.A., Traore, I., Biometric recognition based on free-text keystroke dynamics (2014) IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 44 (4), pp. 458-472; Ahmed, A.A.E., Traore, I., A new biometric technology based on mouse dynamics (2007) IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, 4 (3), pp. 165-179; Bouguessa, M., A practical outlier detection approach for mixed-attribute data (2015) Expert Systems with Applications, 42 (22), pp. 8637-8649; Camiña, J.B., Hernández-Gracidas, C., Monroy, R., Trejo, L., The windows-users and -intruder simulations logs dataset (WUIL): An experimental framework for masquerade detection mechanisms (2014) Expert Systems with Applications, 41 (3), pp. 919-930; CERT Insider Threat Center, (2015) U.S. State of Cybercrime Survey, , http://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetID=298318; Chandola, V., Banerjee, A., Kumar, V., Anomaly detection for discrete sequences: A survey (2012) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 24 (5), pp. 823-839; Cheng, Y., Izadi, I., Chen, T., Pattern matching of alarm flood sequences by a modified Smithâ?

Towards this, we introduce the first tetrahedron (three-dimensional (3D)) based two-server Password Authenticated and Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol to represent text passwords. A 3D PAKE protocol is a hybrid cryptographic algorithm that requires two servers for authentication; one server engages with users and the other is hidden from the clients. A remarkable aspect of the proposed 3D PAKE protocol is that reclaiming password from the stored credentials is not possible when either one/both the servers gets compromised. In this paper, we discuss the properties of tetrahedron that mesh well with Diffie–Hellman key exchange protocol and elliptic curve cryptography encryption scheme and proved that the protocol is resistant against cryptographic attacks without the involvement of public key infrastructure. The proposed protocol is the first provably secure two-server PAKE protocol against an offline dictionary attack. © 2016 IETE.",3D PAKE protocol; Diffie–Hellman key exchange; Elliptic curve cryptography; Security analysis,Computational mechanics; Cryptography; Geometry; Network security; Public key cryptography; Authenticated key exchange protocols; Cryptographic algorithms; Elliptic curve cryptography; Key exchange; Large-scale distributed system; Off-line dictionary attacks; Public key infrastructure; Security analysis; Authentication,,,,,"Choate, J., (1976) “Tetrahedral treats, , http://www.zebragraph.com/Geometers_Corner_files/tetrahedral%20treats.pdf; http://www.cut-the-knot.org/triangle/O-H-I.shtml; Steven, M.M., Bellovin, M., Encrypted key exchange: Password-based protocols secure against dictionary attacks (1992) Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Symposium on Research in Security and Privacy, pp. 72-84. , Oakland, CA; Lin, C., Sun, H., Hwang, T., Three-party encrypted key exchange: Attacks and a solution (2000) ACM Oper.

In order to convert the tracking problem to a regulation problem we augment the system and the reference states and pick appropriately the user-defined matrices. An integral reinforcement learning approach is used to estimate the parameters of the Q-function while also guaranteeing closed-loop stability, trajectory tracking and convergence of the policies to a saddle point.

Advanced network scanning techniques are often used for this purpose and are automatically executed by malware infected hosts. In this paper we formally define network deception to defend reconnaissance and develop RDS (Reconnaissance Deception System), which is based on SDN (Software Defined Networking), to achieve deception by simulating virtual network topologies. Our system thwarts network reconnaissance by delaying the scanning techniques of adversaries and invalidating their collected information, while minimizing the performance impact on benign network traffic. We introduce approaches to defend malicious network discovery and reconnaissance in computer networks, which are required for targeted cyber attacks such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). We show, that our system is able to invalidate an attackers information, delay the process of finding vulnerable hosts and identify the source of adversarial reconnaissance within a network, while only causing a minuscule performance overhead of 0.2 milliseconds per packet ow on average. © 2016 ACM.",,Computer networks;

To overcome this limitation, adversaryaware learning algorithms have been developed, exploiting robust optimization and game-theoretical models to incorporate knowledge of potential adversarial data manipulations into the learning algorithm. Despite these techniques have been shown to be effective in some adversarial learning tasks, their adoption in practice is hindered by different factors, including the difficulty of meeting specific theoretical requirements, the complexity of implementation, and scalability issues, in terms of computational time and space required during training. In this work, we aim to develop secure kernel machines against evasion attacks that are not computationally more demanding than their non-secure counterparts. In particular, leveraging recent work on robustness and regularization, we show that the security of a linear classifier can be drastically improved by selecting a proper regularizer, depending on the kind of evasion attack, as well as unbalancing the cost of classification errors. We then discuss the security of nonlinear kernel machines, and show that a proper choice of the kernel function is crucial. We also show that unbalancing the cost of classification errors and varying some kernel parameters can further improve classifier security, yielding decision functions that better enclose the legitimate data. Our results on spam and PDF malware detection corroborate our analysis. © 2016 ACM.",Adversarial machine learning; Evasion attacks; Kernel methods; Secure learning,Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Game theory; Learning systems; Malware; Optimization; Adversarial learning; Classification errors; Decision functions; Evasion attacks; Game theoretical models; Kernel methods; Robust optimization; Secure learning; Learning algorithms,,,,,"Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., Can machine learning be secure?

As a result, network resources may be left idle, leaving the system in a suboptimal state. This is referred to as the price of anarchy, where agents acting in an uncoordinated fashion make poor decisions when viewed in a global context. In this paper we introduce ABRA, the avoid- ing bottleneck relay algorithm, which can be used to allow some coordination between clients and relays with the aim of increasing network utilization. At peak performance, us- ing ABRA for circuit selection results in almost 20% higher network bandwidth usage compared to vanilla Tor. We find that ABRA significantly outperforms previously suggested circuit selection algorithms based on latency and congestion, and attains similar throughput to a fully centralized online algorithm, while an offine algorithm with knowledge of fu- ture requests could achieve up to 80% more network utiliza- tion than vanilla Tor. Finally, we perform a privacy analysis of ABRA against a passive and active adversary trying to reduce anonymity of clients and increase their view of the Tor network. We find that the algorithm does not enable new passive attacks and that colluding relays experience a minor increase in the fraction of streams compromised when acting in an adversarial manner. © 2016 ACM.",,Active adversary; Anonymity networks; Circuit selection; Net work utilization; Network resource; nocv2; On-line algorithms; Peak performance; Privacy analysis; Traffic congestion,,,,,"Shadow Homepage and Code Repositories, , https://shadow.github.io/https://github.com/shadow/; Akhoondi, M., Yu, C., Madhyastha, H.V., Lastor: A low-latency as-aware tor client (2012) Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, , May; AlSabah, M., Bauer, K., Goldberg, I., Enhancing tor's performance using real-time trafic classification (2012) Proceedings of the 19th ACM conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS 2012), , October; AlSabah, M., Bauer, K., Goldberg, I., Grunwald, D., McCoy, D., Savage, S., Voelker, G., Defenestrator: Throwing out windows in tor (2011) Proceedings of the 11th Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS 2011), , July; AlSabah, M., Goldberg, I., Pctcp: Per-circuit TCP-over-IPsec transport for anonymous communication overlay networks (2013) Proceedings of the 20th ACM conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS 2013), , November; Backes, M., Kate, A., Meiser, S., Mohammadi, E., Mator(s): Monitoring the anonymity of tor's path selection (2014) Proceedings of the 21th ACM conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS 2014), , November; Dingledine, R., Mathewson, N., Syverson, P., Tor: The second-generation onion router (2004) Proceedings of the 13th USENIX Security Symposium, , August; Dingledine, R., Murdoch, S.J., (2009) Performance Improvements on Tor or, Why Tor is Slow and What We're Going to do About It, , http://www.torproject.org/press/presskit/2009-03-11-performance.pdf, Online; Geddes, J., Jansen, R., Hopper, N., Imux: Managing tor connections from two to infinity, and beyond (2014) Proceedings of the 12th Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society (WPES), , November; Gopal, D., Heninger, N., Torchestra: Reducing interactive trafic delays over tor (2012) Proceedings of the Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society (WPES 2012), , ACM, October; Graham, R.L., Lawler, E.L., Lenstra, J.K., Kan, A.R., Optimization and approximation in deterministic sequencing and scheduling: A survey (1979) Annals of Discrete Mathematics, 5, pp. 287-326; Herbert, S., Murdoch, S.J., Punskaya, E., Optimising node selection probabilities in multi-hop m/d/1 queuing networks to reduce latency of tor (2014) Electronics Letters, 50 (17), pp. 1205-1207; Jansen, R., Bauer, K.S., Hopper, N., Dingledine, R., Methodically modeling the tor network (2012) CSET; Jansen, R., Geddes, J., Wacek, C., Sherr, M., Syverson, P., Never been kist: Tor's congestion management blossoms with kernel-informed socket transport (2014) Proceedings of 23rd USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 14), , San Diego, CA, August.

Although the security provisions of Bitcoin have been thoroughly analysed, the security guarantees of variant (forked) PoW blockchains (which were instantiated with different parameters) have not received much attention in the literature. In this paper, we introduce a novel quantitative framework to analyse the security and performance implications of various consensus and network parameters of PoW blockchains. Based on our framework, we devise optimal adversarial strategies for doublespending and selfish mining while taking into account real world constraints such as network propagation, different block sizes, block generation intervals, information propagation mechanism, and the impact of eclipse attacks. Our framework therefore allows us to capture existing PoW-based deployments as well as PoW blockchain variants that are instantiated with different parameters, and to objectively compare the tradeoffs between their performance and security provisions. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

We then apply it to Mylar, a framework that uses multi-key searchable encryption (MKSE) to build Web applications on top of encrypted data. We demonstrate that (1) the Popa-Zeldovich model for MKSE does not imply security against either passive or active attacks; (2) Mylar-based Web applications reveal users' data and queries to passive and active adversarial servers; and (3) Mylar is generically insecure against active attacks due to system design aws. Our results show that the problem of securing client-server applications against actively malicious servers is challenging and still unsolved. We conclude with general lessons for the designers of systems that rely on property-preserving or searchable encryption to protect data from untrusted servers. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",,Cryptography; Active attack; Client-server applications; Encrypted data; Property-preserving; Searchable encryptions; Untrusted server; User data; WEB application; Search engines,,,,,"23andMe, https://www.23andme.com; Agrawal, R., Kiernan, J., Srikant, R., Xu, Y., Order preserving encryption for numeric data (2004) SIGMOD; Akhawe, D., Saxena, P., Song, D., Privilege separation in HTML5 applications (2012) USENIX Security; Apache Lucene, https://lucene.apache.org/core; Apache Tika, https://tika.apache.org; Bellare, M., Boldyreva, A., O'Neill, A., Deterministic and efficiently searchable encryption (2007) CRYPTO; Boldyreva, A., Chenette, N., Lee, Y., O'Neill, A., Order-preserving symmetric encryption (2009) EUROCRYPT; Boneh, D., Lewi, K., Raykova, M., Sahai, A., Zhandry, M., Zimmerman, J., Semantically secure order-revealing encryption: Multi-input functional encryption without obfuscation (2015) EUROCRYPT; Cash, D., Grubbs, P., Perry, J., Ristenpart, T., Leakage-abuse attacks against searchable encryption (2015) CCS; Cash, D., Jaeger, J., Jarecki, S., Jutla, C.S., Krawczyk, H., Rosu, M.-C., Steiner, M., Dynamic searchable encryption in very-large databases: Data structures and implementation (2014) NDSS; Cash, D., Jarecki, S., Jutla, C., Krawczyk, H., Rosu, M.-C., Steiner, M., Highly-scalable searchable symmetric encryption with support for Boolean queries (2013) CRYPTO; Chapman, P., Evans, D., Automated black-box detection of side-channel vulnerabilities in Web applications (2011) CCS; Chen, S., Wang, R., Wang, X., Zhang, K., Side-channel leaks in Web applications: A reality today, a challenge tomorrow (2010) S&P; Cheng, R., Scott, W., Ellenbogen, P., Howell, J., Anderson, T., Radiatus: Strong user isolation for scalable Web applications (2014) Univ.

On the ip side, various attacks have emerged that show that for some of these protocols confidentiality of the data can be compromised, usually given certain auxiliary information. We take a step back and identify a need for a formal understanding of the inherent efficiency/privacy trade-off in outsourced database systems, independent of the details of the system. We propose abstract models that capture secure outsourced storage systems in sufficient generality, and identify two basic sources of leakage, namely access pattern and communication volume. We use our models to distinguish certain classes of outsourced database systems that have been proposed, and deduce that all of them exhibit at least one of these leakage sources. We then develop generic reconstruction attacks on any system supporting range queries where either access pattern or communication volume is leaked. These attacks are in a rather weak passive adversarial model, where the untrusted server knows only the underlying query distribution. In particular, to perform our attack the server need not have any prior knowledge about the data, and need not know any of the issued queries nor their results. Yet, the server can reconstruct the secret attribute of every record in the database after about N4 queries, where N is the domain size. We provide a matching lower bound showing that our attacks are essentially optimal. Our reconstruction attacks using communication volume apply even to systems based on homomorphic encryption or oblivious RAM in the natural way. Finally, we provide experimental results demonstrating the efficacy of our attacks on real datasets with a variety of different features. On all these datasets, after the required number of queries our attacks successfully recovered the secret attributes of every record in at most a few seconds. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Generic attacks;

One of the first attacks against privacy of biological data, proposed by Homer et al. in 2008, showed that, by knowing parts of the genome of a given individual and summary statistics of a genome-based study, it is possible to detect if this individual participated in the study. Since then, a lot of work has been carried out to further study the theoretical limits and to counter the genomebased membership inference attack. However, genomic data are by no means the only or the most influential biological data threatening personal privacy. For instance, whereas the genome informs us about the risk of developing some diseases in the future, epigenetic biomarkers, such as microRNAs, are directly and deterministically affected by our health condition including most common severe diseases. In this paper, we show that the membership inference attack also threatens the privacy of individuals contributing their microRNA expressions to scientific studies. Our results on real and public microRNA expression data demonstrate that disease-specific datasets are especially prone to membership detection, offering a true-positive rate of up to 77% at a false-negative rate of less than 1%. We present two attacks: one relying on the L1 distance and the other based on the likelihood-ratio test. We show that the likelihood-ratio test provides the highest adversarial success and we derive a theoretical limit on this success. In order to mitigate the membership inference, we propose and evaluate both a differentially private mechanism and a hiding mechanism. We also consider two types of adversarial prior knowledge for the differentially private mechanism and show that, for relatively large datasets, this mechanism can protect the privacy of participants in miRNA-based studies against strong adversaries without degrading the data utility too much. Based on our findings and given the current number of miRNAs, we recommend to only release summary statistics of datasets containing at least a couple of hundred individuals. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

By casting the problem in a game-theoretic framework and by exploiting the parallelism between the attacker's goal and optimal transport theory, we introduce the concept of security margin defined as the maximum average per-sample distortion introduced by the attacker for which the two sources can be distinguished ensuring arbitrarily small, yet positive, error exponents for type I and type II error probabilities. Several versions of the problem are considered according to the available knowledge about the sources. We compute the security margin for some classes of sources and derive general bounds assuming that the distortion is measured in terms of the mean square error between the original and the attacked sequence. The analysis of the game and the study of the distinguishability of the sources are extended to the case in which the distortion constraint is defined in terms of the maximum distance. © 2016 IEEE.",Adversarial signal processing; cybersecurity; earth mover distance (EMD); game theory; hypothesis testing; multimedia forensics; optimal transportation theory; source identification,Errors; Mean square error; Probability; Probability distributions; Signal processing; Statistical mechanics; Cyber security; Earth mover distances; Hypothesis testing; Multimedia forensics; Optimal transportations; Source identification; Game theory,,,,,"Barni, M., Pérez-González, F., Coping with the enemy: Advances in adversary-aware signal processing (2013) Proc.

However, these networks also expose their vulnerabilities to a great number of threats such as adversarial attacks on the Internet, cyber-crimes on the WWW or malware propagations on social networks. Although power-law networks have been found robust under random attacks and vulnerable to intentional attacks via experimental observations, how to better understand their vulnerabilities from a theoretical point of view still remains open. In this paper, we study the vulnerability of power-law networks under random attacks and adversarial attacks using the in-depth probabilistic analysis on the theory of random power-law graph models. Our results indicate that power-law networks are able to tolerate random failures if their exponential factor β is &lt; 2.9, and they are more robust against intentional attacks if β is smaller. Furthermore, we reveal the best range [ 1.8 , 2.5 ] for the exponential factor β by optimizing the complex networks in terms of both their vulnerabilities and costs. When β&lt; 1.8 , the network maintenance cost is very expensive, and when β&gt; 2.5 the network robustness is unpredictable since it depends on the specific attacking strategy. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Optimization; Power-law networks; Probabilistic analysis; Robustness,Computer crime; Graph theory; Internet; Maintenance; Malware; Optimization; Robustness (control systems); Social networking (online); Web browsers; Exponential factors; Intentional Attacks; Malware propagation; Network maintenance costs; Power law distribution; Power-law networks; Probabilistic analysis; Random power-law graphs; Complex networks,,,,,"Aiello W, Chung F, Lu L (2000) A random graph model for massive graphs.

Due to the unique industrial control operating environment, standard information technology host-based defenses such as operating system upgrades are not always feasible. Therefore, ICS security strategies must rely upon layered network infrastructure and enclave boundary defenses. As ICS threats evolve, so too must ICS security practices and strategies. ICS security innovation rely upon understanding the effectiveness of established defenses and countermeasures. In an effort to evaluate the security effectiveness of ICS layered perimeter defenses, a Red Team security assessment was conducted on an ICS test network. This experiment offers insight to the effectiveness of ICS perimeter defenses by demonstrating the reduction of attack vectors, decreased adversarial network access, and perimeter network defenses are an effective ICS security strategy. © 2016 ACM.",Industrial control system security; Industrial control system security assessment,Control systems; Intelligent control; Malware; Network layers; Adversarial networks; Industrial control system securities; Industrial control systems; Industrial controls; Operating environment; Perimeter networks; Security assessment; Security strategies; Network security,,,,,"Falliere, N., O'Murchu, L., Chien, E., (2011) W32.

We consider a team of autonomous agents whose mission is to cooperatively achieve and maintain formation by cyclic pursuit where each agent depends only on information from a single neighbor for mission completion. Agents communicate through a wireless interface that is susceptible to adversarial attacks. The attacker can target any number of communication links with the aim of corrupting information transmitted between agents disrupting their collective mission. The proposed secured formation control strategy is based on continuous on-line system identification. An Identified model of the multi-Agent system is locally implemented alongside the actual system for each agent enabling agents retrieve their desired dynamic behavior in the presence of a DOS attack. The proposed technique is demonstrated through a laboratory experiment with a team of 5 pioneer 3DX robots. © 2016 IEEE.,,Autonomous agents; Computer crime; Denial-of-service attack; National security; Security systems; Actual system; Cyclic pursuit; Denial of Service; Dynamic behaviors; Formation control; Laboratory experiments; Mission completion; Wireless interfaces; Multi agent systems,,,,,"(2009) The Real Story of Stuxnet, , Spectrum, ieee.org.

As the cyber environment has expanded and become more complex, so have the nature of adversaries and styles of attacks. Today, cyber incidents are an expected part of life. As a result, cybersecurity research emerged to address adversarial attacks interfering with or preventing normal cyber activities. Historical response to cybersecurity attacks is heavily skewed to tactical responses with an emphasis on rapid recovery. While threat mitigation is important and can be time critical, a knowledge gap exists with respect to developing the science of cybersecurity. Such a science will enable the development and testing of theories that lead to understanding the broad sweep of cyber threats and the ability to assess trade-offs in sustaining network missions while mitigating attacks. The Asymmetric Resilient Cybersecurity Initiative at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is a multi-year, multi-million dollar investment to develop approaches for shifting the advantage to the defender and sustaining the operability of systems under attack. The initiative established a Science Council to focus attention on the research process for cybersecurity. The Council shares science practices, critiques research plans, and AIDS in documenting and reporting reproducible research results. The Council members represent ecology, economics, statistics, physics, computational chemistry, microbiology and genetics, and geochemistry. This paper reports the initial work of the Science Council to implement the scientific method in cybersecurity research. The second section describes the scientific method. The third section in this paper discusses scientific practices for cybersecurity research. Section four describes initial impacts of applying the science practices to cybersecurity research. © 2016 IEEE.",,Ability testing; Complex networks; Computation theory; Economic and social effects; Economics; National security; Security systems; Development and testing; Pacific northwest national laboratories; Rapid recovery; Reproducible research; Research process; Scientific method; Tactical response; Threat mitigation; Computational chemistry,,,,,"http://www.computerweekly.com/news/1280095471/RSA-hit-byadvanced-persistent-Threat-Attacks; http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/8553131/Google-Gmailcyber-Attack-Chinese-spies-had-months-of-Access.html; Mitre, J., (2010) Science of Cyber-Security, , fas.org/irp/agency/dod/jason/cyber.pdf, Nov; Schneider, F.B., Blueprint for a science of cybersecurity (2012) The Next Wave, 19 (2); https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/22943/SoS%20blueprint.pdf?sequence=2; https://www.nsa.gov/research/tnw/tnw194/articles/article13.shtml; Spinola, S., (2013) Addressing the Challenges of Cybersecurity R&D, , http://www.21ct.com/blog/addressing-The-challenges-ofcybersecurity-rd/, 21CT; Popper, K.R., The Logic of Scientific Discovery, p. 2002. , Routledge Classics, 2nd edition 544; Kuhn, T.S., (2012) The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, 264. , The University of Chicago 4th edition; Feyerabend, P., (1993) Against Method, p. 279. , 3rd Edition Verso; Crawford, S., Stucki, L., Peer review and the changing research record (1990) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 41, pp. 223-228; Lohr, K.N., Rating the strength of scientific evidence: Relevance for quality improvement programs (2004) International Journal for Quality in Health Care 2004, 16 (1), pp. 9-18. , Feb; Druckman, J.N., Green, D.P., Kuklinski, J.H., Lupia, A., (2011) Cambridge Handbook of Experimental Political Science, , Cambridge University Press; Zar J, H., (2010) Biostatistical Analysis, 944. , 5th edition Prentice Hall; Box, G.E.P., Hunter, J.S., Hunter, W.G., (2005) Statistics for Experimenters: Design, Innovaton, and Discovery, , 2nd edition.

Trust relationships in particular can be exploited in such sys- tems for rating prediction and recommendation, which has been shown to have the potential for improving the quality of the recommender and alleviating the issue of data sparsity, cold start, and adversarial attacks. An appropriate trust in- ference mechanism is necessary in extending the knowledge base of trust opinions and tackling the issue of limited trust information due to connection sparsity of social networks. In this work, we offer a new solution to trust inference in social networks to provide a better knowledge base for trust- aware recommender systems. We propose using a semiring framework as a nonlinear way to combine trust evidences for inferring trust, where trust relationship is model as 2- D vector containing both trust and certainty information. The trust propagation and aggregation rules, as the build- ing blocks of our trust inference scheme, are based upon the properties of trust relationships. In our approach, both trust and distrust (i.e., positive and negative trust) are considered, and opinion conict resolution is supported. We evaluate the proposed approach on real-world datasets, and show that our trust inference framework has high accuracy, and is ca- pable of handling trust relationship in large networks. The inferred trust relationships can enlarge the knowledge base for trust information and improve the quality of trust-aware recommendation. © 2016 ACM.",,Decision making; Knowledge based systems; Recommender systems; Aggregation rules; Real-world datasets; Social networking systems; Social relationships; Trust inferences; Trust propagation; Trust relationship; Trust-aware recommender systems; Social networking (online),,,,,"(2014) Epinions Trust Network Dataset-KONECT, , Oct; Aggarwal, C.C., Social and trust-centric recommender systems (2016) Recommender Systems, , Springer; Andersen, R., Borgs, C., Chayes, J., Feige, U., Flaxman, A., Kalai, A., Mirrokni, V., Tennenholtz, M., Trust-based recommendation systems: An axiomatic approach (2008) WWW; Avesani, P., Massa, P., Tiella, R., A trust-enhanced recommender system application: Moleskiing (2005) ACM SAC; Bistarelli, S., Semirings for soft constraint solving and programming volume 2962 (2004) Springer Science & Business Media; Castelfranchi, C., Falcone, R., (2010) Trust Theory: A Socio-Cognitive and Computational Model Volume 18, , John Wiley & Sons; DuBois, T., Golbeck, J., Srinivasan, A., Predicting trust and distrust in social networks (2011) Privacy, Security, Risk and Trust (PASSAT) and IEEE SocialCom; Forsati, R., Barjasteh, I., Masrour, F., Esfahanian, A.-H., Radha, H., Pushtrust: An efficient recommendation algorithm by leveraging trust and distrust relations (2015) ACM RecSys; Gao, P., Baras, J.S., Golbeck, J., Semiring-based trust evaluation for information fusion in social network services (2015) IEEE Fusion; Golbeck, J., (2005) Computing and Applying Trust in Web-Based Social Networks, , PhD thesis University of Maryland College Park; Golbeck, J., Personalizing applications through integration of inferred trust values in semantic web-based social networks (2005) Semantic Network Analysis Workshop at ISWC; Golbeck, J., (2006) Generating Predictive Movie Recommendations from Trust in Social Networks, , Springer; Golbeck, J., (2008) Computing with Social Trust, , Springer; Guha, R., Kumar, R., Raghavan, P., Tomkins, A., Propagation of trust and distrust (2004) WWW; Haydar, C., Roussanaly, A., Boyer, A., Local trust versus global trust networks in subjective logic 2013 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conferences on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technologies; Jamali, M., Ester, M., Trustwalker: A random walk model for combining trust-based and item-based recommendation (2009) ACM KDD; Jamali, M., Ester, M., A matrix factorization technique with trust propagation for recommendation in social networks (2010) ACM RecSys; Jøsang, A., Ismail, R., Boyd, C., A survey of trust and reputation systems for online service provision (2007) Decision Support Systems, 43 (2), pp. 618-644; Jøsang, A., Marsh, S., Pope, S., Exploring different types of trust propagation (2006) Trust Management, pp. 179-192. , Springer; Leskovec, J., Huttenlocher, D., Kleinberg, J., Predicting positive and negative links in online social networks (2010) WWW; London, B., Getoor, L., Collective classification of network data (2014) Data Classification: Algorithms and Applications, 399; Ma, H., King, I., Lyu, M.R., Learning to recommend with social trust ensemble (2009) ACM SIGIR; Ma, H., Lyu, M.R., King, I., Learning to recommend with trust and distrust relationships (2009) ACM RecSys; Ma, H., Yang, H., Lyu, M.R., King, I., Sorec: Social recommendation using probabilistic matrix factorization (2008) ACM SIGIR; Massa, P., Avesani, P., Trust-Aware recommender systems (2007) ACM RecSys; Neville, J., Jensen, D., Iterative classification in relational data (2000) Proc.

We posit that a special class of behaviourally self-similar systems exhibits a degree of resilience to adversarial behaviour. We formalise the notions of system, adversary and resilience in operational terms, based on transition systems and observations. While the general problem of proving systems to be behaviourally self-similar is undecidable, we show, by casting them in the framework of well-structured transition systems, that there is an interesting class of systems for which the problem is decidable. We illustrate our prescriptive framework for resilience with some small examples, e.g., systems robust to failures in a fail-stop model, and those avoiding side-channel attacks. © S. Prasad & L. D.

Signal injection attacks target, the usually unprotected, analog sensing interface of the sensors in a BSN and induce arbitrary signals in them. Signal injection is very dangerous because can be stealthily mounted on unsuspecting BSN users from close proximity (for example in a public place). Inducing morphological alterations in ECG measurements can have profound consequences for the user, as an adversary can easily make a person who is experiencing cardiac arrhythmia appear to be normal and thus cause immediate or long-term harm to their health. To detect signal injection-based morphological alterations, we leverage the idea that multiple physiological signals based on the same underlying physiological process (e.g., cardiac process) are inherently related to each other, i.e., have common features. Any adversarial alteration of one of the signals will not be reflected in the other signal(s) in the group. Therefore, to detect the morphological alterations in ECG measurements, we use arterial blood pressure (ABP) measurements. Both ECG and ABP measurements are alternative representation of the cardiac process. Our approach demonstrates promising results with over 90% accuracy in detecting even subtle ECG morphological alterations for both healthy subjects and those with cardiac conditions. © 2016 IEEE.",,Blood pressure; Body sensor networks; Distributed computer systems; Electrocardiography; Heart; Physiology; Arbitrary signals; Arterial blood pressure; Body sensor networks (BSN); Cardiac arrhythmia; Morphological alteration; Physiological process; Physiological signals; Signal injection; Signal detection,,,,,"Kermani, M., Zhang, M., Raghunathan, A., Jha, N., Emerging frontiers in embedded security (2013) VLSI Design and 2013 12th International Conference on Embedded Systems (VLSID), 2013 26th International Conference on, pp. 203-208. , Jan; Uluagac, A., Subramanian, V., Beyah, R., Sensory channel threats to cyber physical systems: A wake-up call (2014) Communications and Network Security (CNS), 2014 IEEE Conference on, pp. 301-309. , Oct; 10-Second' Theoretical Hack Could Jog Fitbits into Malwarespreading Mode, , http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/10/21/fitbit\hack/; Foo Kune, D., Backes, J., Clark, S.S., Kramer, D.B., Reynolds, M.R., Fu, K., Kim, Y., Xu, W., Ghost Talk: Mitigating EMI signal injection attacks against analog sensors (2013) Proceedings of the 34th Annual IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, , https://spqr.eecs.umich.edu/papers/fookune-emi-oakland13.pdf, May [Online].

As such, they are preferred targets for criminal and terrorist groups, who are attracted by the promisingly high revenues they might get from an attack. Every year, airport authorities worldwide have to face, with limited resources, attacks arising from different adversaries. There are several sensible areas within an airport organization that are especially vulnerable to the terrorist threat, including, among others: (1) those related to human lives (of passengers or staff); (2) airport infrastructure (airport perimeter, main terminal, Air Traffic Control Tower, runways, hangars, etc.); (3) aircrafts and other ground vehicles; and (4) IT systems and services. Besides the more traditional ones, we are particularly concerned with attacks launched against the last type of targets, an emerging and increasingly worrisome threat. Specifically, we analyze the impact of cyber-attacks launched by organized groups whose main goal is to take hold of airport operations. In some cases, in order to have more chances to achieve their purpose (and take advantage of its eventual success), cyber attackers may be backed up by a terrorist group who will try to interfere with the Air Traffic Management network. In this paper, we aim at supporting airport authorities in their fight against both threats, by devising a security allocation plan. We provide an adversarial risk analysis model to address the problem, and apply it to obtain the optimal portfolio of preventive measures in an illustrative case study. The model is open to extensions, as e.g. larger and more complex technical infrastructures, new threats, or additional recovery measures deployed by different defensive agents. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",adversarial risk analysis; Air Traffic Management security; airport case study; cyber-attacks; intelligent coordinated attackers,Air traffic control; Airport security; Airports; Amphibious vehicles; Complex networks; Computer crime; Control towers; Crashworthiness; Crime; Economics; Ground vehicles; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Terrorism; Traffic control; Adversarial risk analysis; Air Traffic Management; Airport authorities; Airport infrastructure; Cyber-attacks; intelligent coordinated attackers; Preventive measures; Technical infrastructure; Airport vehicular traffic,,,,,"Ashford, N.J., Mumayiz, S., Wright, P.H., (2011) Airport Engineering: Planning, Design and Development of 21st Century Airports, , 4th ed., Hoboken, NJ: Wiley; Aven, T., Renn, O., On Risk Defined as an Event where the Outcome is Uncertain (2009) Journal of Risk Research, 12 (1), pp. 1-11; Ayra, E.S., Ríos Insua, D., Cano, J., Calle, F., (2015) A Probabilistic Influence Diagram for Runway Excursion Risk Analysis, , Submitted for publication; Basak, S., Shapiro, A., Value-at-risk-based Risk Management: Optimal Policies and Asset Prices (2001) Review of Financial Studies, 14 (2), pp. 371-405; Bedford, T., Cooke, R.M., (2001) Probabilistic Risk Analysis: Foundations and Methods, , New York: Cambridge University Press; Berger, J.O., (1985) Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis, , 2nd ed., Berlin: Springer-Verlag; Brandt, U.S., The Implication of Extreme Events on Policy Responses (2013) Journal of Risk Research, 17 (2), pp. 221-240; Cano, J., Ríos Insua, D., Tedeschi, A., Turhan, U., Security Economics: An Adversarial Risk Analysis Approach to Airport Protection (2015) Annals of Operations Research; Carr, J., (2011) Inside Cyber Warfare: Mapping the Cyber Underworld, , 2nd ed., Ebook, Sebastopol, CA: O’Reilly Media; Cheung, S., Lindqvist, U., Fong, M.W., (2003) Modeling Multistep Cyber Attacks for Scenario Recognition, 1, pp. 284-292. , Proceedings of DARPA, Information Survivability Conference and Exposition; Čokorilo, O., De Luca, M., Dell’Acqua, G., Aircraft Safety Analysis Using Clustering Algorithms (2014) Journal of Risk Research, 17 (10), pp. 1325-1340; Coles, S., (2001) An Introduction to Statistical Modeling of Extreme Values, , London: Springer-Verlag; (2012) Manual for National ATM Security Oversight, , DSS/CM/SEC/DEL/12-044, Brussels: Eurocontrol; (2008) ICT Security Guidance Material.

Message formats in XML-based protocols are usually specified in XML Schema, and as a first-line defense, schema validation should reject malformed input. However, extension points in most protocol specifications break validation. Extension points are wildcards and considered best practice for loose composition, but they also enable an attacker to add unchecked content in a document, e.g., for a signature wrapping attack. This paper introduces datatyped XML visibly pushdown automata (dXVPAs) as language representation for mixed-content XML and presents an incremental learner that infers a dXVPA from example documents. The learner generalizes XML types and datatypes in terms of automaton states and transitions, and an inferred dXVPA converges to a good-enough approximation of the true language. The automaton is free from extension points and capable of stream validation, e.g., as an anomaly detector for XML-based protocols. For dealing with adversarial training data, two scenarios of poisoning are considered: a poisoning attack is either uncovered at a later time or remains hidden. Unlearning can therefore remove an identified poisoning attack from a dXVPA, and sanitization trims low-frequent states and transitions to get rid of hidden attacks. All algorithms have been evaluated in four scenarios, including a web service implemented in Apache Axis2 and Apache Rampart, where attacks have been simulated. In all scenarios, the learned automaton had zero false positives and outperformed traditional schema validation. © 2016 IEEE.",anomaly detection; experimental evaluation; grammatical inference; stream validation; visibly pushdown automata; XML,Automata theory; Hypertext systems; Signal detection; Web services; Anomaly detection; Experimental evaluation; Grammatical inferences; stream validation; Visibly pushdown automaton; XML,,,,,"(2008), http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/, W3C, Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition), Nov. accessed 2014-02-17.

On the other hand, physical layer security is a critical issue of wireless communications in the presence of adversaries. Recently, these two important fields tend to be researched closely together. In this article, some of the key results are summarized, and two primary attacks at the physical layer of IA-based networks, adversarial jamming and eavesdropping, are further studied. We first propose an anti-jamming scheme by aligning the jamming signal together with interference among users cooperatively when an adversarial jammer exists. Then an AN scheme is proposed, in which the external eavesdropping is disrupted by AN without introducing any additional interference to the legitimate network. To further analyze the potential threat, a collusive eavesdropping scheme by some hostile IA users in the network is also proposed. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of these schemes. Finally, some future challenges are also summarized. © 2016 IEEE.",,Jamming; Network layers; Security systems; Wireless telecommunication systems; Future challenges; Future wireless networks; Interference alignment; Interference management; Physical layer security; Physical layers; Potential threats; Wireless communications; Wireless networks,,,,,"Zhang, S., Liew, S.C., Chen, J., The capacity of known interference channel (2015) IEEE JSAC, 33 (6), pp. 1241-1252. , Jun; Cadambe, V.R., Jafar, S.A., Interference alignment and degrees of freedom of the K-user interference channel (2008) IEEE Trans.

We provide a systematic approach rooted from the information theory to evaluate the basic performance limits of RF fingerprinting. We develop a novel channel model for RF fingerprinting, where the imperfections in the RF chain are modeled as a fingerprint channel, cascaded to the actual physical channel. We address the authentication problem in the presence of an adversary, where both the legitimate transmitter and the adversary are equipped with unique fingerprint channels, in addition to a possible secret key available at the legitimate nodes. We provide bounds for the error exponents for reliable communication of the legitimate nodes, and the success exponent for impersonation and substitution attacks of the adversary, as a function of certain parameters based on their RF-fingerprints, and the shared key rate. We illustrate that keyless authentication is possible via RF fingerprints when the legitimate channel is not simulatable. We also show that the probability of these attacks can be reduced significantly by employing additional dedicated authenticated nodes. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",authentication; cybersecurity; error exponent; impersonation attack; keyless authentication; RF-Fingerprinting; secrecy exponent; secure communication; simulatability; substitution attack,Authentication; Chains; Error correction; Information theory; Radio stations; Radio transmission; Secure communication; Transmitters; Cyber security; Error exponent; Impersonation attack; RF-Fingerprinting; secrecy exponent; Simulatability; Substitution attack; Cryptography,,,,,"Gungor, O., Koksal, C.E., El Gamal, H., An information theoretic approach to rf fingerprinting (2013) Proc.

Most detection mechanisms attempt to classify user accounts as real (i.e., benign, honest) or fake (i.e., malicious, Sybil) by analyzing either user-level activities or graph-level structures. These mechanisms, however, are not robust against adversarial attacks in which fake accounts cloak their operation with patterns resembling real user behavior. In this article, we show that victims - real accounts whose users have accepted friend requests sent by fakes - form a distinct classification category that is useful for designing robust detection mechanisms. In particular, we present Íntegro - a robust and scalable defense system that leverages victim classification to rank most real accounts higher than fakes, so that OSN operators can take actions against low-ranking fake accounts. Íntegro starts by identifying potential victims from user-level activities using supervised machine learning. After that, it annotates the graph by assigning lower weights to edges incident to potential victims. Finally, Íntegro ranks user accounts based on the landing probability of a short random walk that starts from a known real account. As this walk is unlikely to traverse low-weight edges in a few steps and land on fakes, Íntegro achieves the desired ranking. We implemented Íntegro using widely-used, open-source distributed computing platforms, where it scaled nearly linearly. We evaluated Íntegro against SybilRank, which is the state-of-the-art in fake account detection, using real-world datasets and a large-scale deployment at Tuenti - the largest OSN in Spain with more than 15 million active users. We show that Íntegro significantly outperforms SybilRank in user ranking quality, with the only requirement that the employed victim classifier is better than random. Moreover, the deployment of Íntegro at Tuenti resulted in up to an order of magnitude higher precision in fake account detection, as compared to SybilRank. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We deploy a Sequential Defend-Attack model for each type of threat and site, under the assumption that different attackers are uncoordinated, although cascading effects are contemplated. The models are related by resource constraints and results are aggregated over the sites for each participant and, for the Defender, by value aggregation across threats. We illustrate the model with a case study in which we support a railway operator in allocating resources to protect from two threats: fare evasion and pickpocketing.

An attacker compromises the input stream and modifies the control signals transmitted with the objective of increasing the quadratic cost incurred by the controller whilst maintaining a degree of stealthiness. The optimal adversarial control signals are characterized for a finite horizon LQG problem. The tradeoff between the increase in quadratic cost, and the detectability of data injection, as measured by the K-L divergence between legitimate and falsified data dynamics, is derived analytically. The optimal adversarial control signals are shown to be additive white Gaussian, independent of the state, with the sequence of variances derived as a function of system parameters and the desired cost increase. © 2016 American Automatic Control Council (AACC).",,,,,,,"Mo, Y., Sinopoli, B., False data injection attacks in control systems (2010) Preprints of the 1st Workshop on Secure Control Systems, pp. 1-6; Ye, F., Luo, H., Lu, S., Zhang, L., Statistical en-route filtering of injected false data in sensor networks (2005) Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Journal on, 23 (4), pp. 839-850; Kosut, O., Jia, L., Thomas, R.J., Tong, L., Malicious data attacks on the smart grid (2011) Smart Grid, IEEE Transactions on, 2 (4), pp. 645-658; Liu, Y., Ning, P., Reiter, M.K., False data injection attacks against state estimation in electric power grids (2011) ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC), 14 (1), p. 13; Xie, L., Mo, Y., Sinopoli, B., Integrity data attacks in power market operations (2011) Smart Grid, IEEE Transactions on, 2 (4), pp. 659-666; Lin, J., Yu, W., Yang, X., Xu, G., Zhao, W., On false data injection attacks against distributed energy routing in smart grid (2012) Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS), 2012 IEEE/ACM Third International Conference On.

We use Markov chains to design randomized patrolling paths on graphs. We present four different intruder models, each of which use information about the patrolling path in a different manner. We characterize the expected rewards for those intruder models as a function of the Markov chain that is being used for patrolling. We show that minimizing the reward functions is a non-convex optimization problem. We propose a pattern search based algorithm to determine a locally optimal patrolling strategy. We also show that for a certain type of intruder, a deterministic patrolling policy given by an orienteering tour of the graph is the optimal patrolling strategy. © 2016 American Automatic Control Council (AACC).",,,,,,,"Agmon, N., Kraus, S., Kaminka, G., Multi-robot perimeter patrol in adversarial settings (2008) IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 2339-2345. , May; Acevedo, J.J., Arrue, B.C., Maza, I., Ollero, A., Cooperative perimeter surveillance with a team of mobile robots under communication constraints (2013) IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pp. 5067-5072; Smith, S.L., Schwager, M., Rus, D., Persistent robotic tasks: Monitoring and sweeping in changing environments (2012) IEEE Transactions on Robotics, 28 (2), pp. 410-426; Portugal, D., Rocha, R.P., Multi-robot patrolling algorithms: Examining performance and scalability (2013) Advanced Robotics, 27 (5), pp. 325-336; Yu, J., Karaman, S., Rus, D., Persistent monitoring of events with stochastic arrivals at multiple stations (2014) IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 5758-5765. , Hong Kong, May; Chevaleyre, Y., Theoretical analysis of the multi-agent patrolling problem (2004) IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology, pp. 302-308. , Beijing, China, Sep; Alamdari, S., Fata, E., Smith, S.L., Persistent monitoring in discrete environments: Minimizing the maximum weighted latency between observations (2014) International Journal of Robotics Research, 33 (1), pp. 138-154; Srivastava, K., Stipanovic, D., Spong, M., On a stochastic robotic surveillance problem (2009) IEEE Conference on Decision and Control and Chinese Control Conference, pp. 8567-8574. , Dec; Grace, J., Baillieul, J., Stochastic strategies for autonomous robotic surveillance (2005) IEEE Conference on Decision and Control and European Control Conference, pp. 2200-2205. , Dec; Patel, R., Agharkar, P., Bullo, F., Robotic surveillance and markov chains with minimal weighted kemeny constant (2015) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 60 (12), pp. 3156-3167. , Dec; Kemeny, J.G., Snell, J.L., (1976) Finite Markov Chains, , Springer; Boyd, S., Diaconis, P., Xiao, L., Fastest mixing Markov chain on a graph (2004) SIAM Review, 46 (4), pp. 667-689; Alam, T., Edwards, M., Bobadilla, L., Shell, D., Distributed multirobot area patrolling in adversarial environments (2015) International Workshop on Robotic Sensor Networks, , Seattle, WA, USA, Apr; Sak, T., Wainer, J., Goldenstein, S.K., Probabilistic multiagent patrolling (2008) 19th Brazilian Symposium on Artificial Intelligence: Advances in Artificial Intelligence, Ser.

The existing version-stamping-based mechanism (VSM) could guarantee per-packet consistency, but this mechanism is designed for non-adversarial settings and can be compromised easily by a malicious attacker. In this paper, we propose an efficient flow-ordered update mechanism that aims to provide per-packet consistency in adversarial settings. Our proposal does not need to stamp data packets with the configuration version, and is robust against both the packet-tampering and packet-dropping attacks. It outperforms a naive mechanism that simply patches VSM using digital signatures in three aspects: First, the switches in this mechanism only need to sign and verify a single control packet, which significantly improves the packet processing time. Second, it avoids keeping both old and new policies on switches during the update, and thus achieves better space efficiency. Third, it reduces the time delay for new policies to come into force. We evaluate our mechanism on a self-constructed SDN testbed and the results demonstrate high efficiency. © 2016 IEEE.",Consistent Update; Network Security; Software Defined Networking,Efficiency; Network security; Packet networks; Software defined networking; Time delay; Time switches; Consistent Update; Multiple switches; Non-adversarial setting; Packet dropping attack; Packet processing; Software defined networking (SDN); Space efficiencies; Update mechanisms; Computer software,,,,,"Chakrabarti, A., Manimaran, G., Internet infrastructure security: A taxonomy (2002) Network, IEEE, 16 (6), pp. 13-21; Curtis, A.R., Mogul, J.C., Tourrilhes, J., Yalagandula, P., Sharma, P., Banerjee, S., Devoflow: Scaling flow management for high-performance networks (2011) Proc. of SIGCOMM, pp. 254-265; Hong, S., Xu, L., Wang, H., Gu, G., Poisoning network visibility in software-defined networks: New attacks and countermeasures (2015) NDSS; Katta, N.P., Rexford, J., Walker, D., Incremental consistent updates (2013) Proc. of 2nd HotSDN, pp. 49-54; Kreutz, D., Ramos, F., Verissimo, P., Towards secure and dependable software-defined networks (2013) Proc. of 2nd HotSDN, pp. 55-60. , ACM; Mahajan, R., Wattenhofer, R., (2013) On Consistent Updates in Software Defined Networks, , Technical Report MSR-TR-2013-99, Microsoft Research; McGeer, R., A safe, efficient update protocol for openflow networks (2012) Proc. of 1st HotSDN, pp. 61-66; McGeer, R., A correct, zero-overhead protocol for network updates (2013) Proc. of HotSDN, pp. 161-162; McKeown, N., Anderson, T., Balakrishnan, H., Parulkar, G., Peterson, L., Rexford, J., Shenker, S., Turner, J., Openflow: Enabling innovation in campus networks (2008) SIGCOMM Comput.

In a system with n servers implementing a regular register, our construction tolerates faults (or attacks) that can be abstracted by agents that are moved (in an arbitrary and unforeseen manner) by a computationally unbounded adversary from a server to another in order to deviate the server's computation. When a server is infected by an adversarial agent, it behaves arbitrarily until the adversary decides to ""move"" the agent to another server. We investigate the case where the movements of the mobile Byzantine agents are decided by the adversary and are completely decoupled from the message communication delay. Our emulation spans two awareness models: servers with and without self-diagnosis mechanism. In the first case servers are aware that the mobile Byzantine agent has left and hence they can stop running the protocol until they recover a correct state while in the second case, servers are not aware of their faulty state and continue to run the protocol using an incorrect local state. Our results, proven optimal with respect to the threshold of the tolerated mobile Byzantine faults in the first model, are significantly different from the round-based synchronous models. Another interesting side result of our study is that, contrary to the round-based synchronous consensus implementation for systems prone to mobile Byzantine faults, our storage emulation does not rely on the necessity of a core of correct processes all along the computation. That is, every server in the system can be compromised by the mobile Byzantine agents at some point in the computation. This leads to another interesting conclusion: storage is easier than consensus in synchronous settings, when the system is hit by mobile Byzantine failures. © 2016 ACM.",,Distributed computer systems; Adversarial agent; Awareness model; Byzantine failures; Distributed storage; Extended abstracts; Message communication; Message passing systems; Synchronous models; Mobile agents,,,,,"Banu, N., Souissi, S., Izumi, T., Wada, K., An improved byzantine agreement algorithm for synchronous systems with mobile faults (2012) International Journal of Computer Applications, 43, p. 22. , 1-7, April; Bazzi, R.A., Synchronous byzantine quorum systems (2000) Distributed Computing, 13 (1), pp. 45-52. , January; Bonnet, F., Défago, X., Nguyen, T.D., Potop-Butucaru, M., Tight bound on mobile byzantine agreement (2014) Distributed Computing-28th International Symposium, DISC 2014, pp. 76-90. , Austin, TX, USA, October 12-15, 2014.

Here there are two players, a defender and an attacker. The defender wants to allocate her limited resources to defend critical targets and the attacker seeks his most favorable target to attack. In the past decade, there has been a surge of research interest in analyzing and solving security games that are motivated by applications from various domains. Remarkably, these models and their game-theoretic solutions have led to real-world deployments in use by major security agencies like the LAX airport, the US Coast Guard and Federal Air Marshal Service, as well as non-governmental organizations. Among all these research and applications, equilibrium computation serves as a foundation. This paper examines security games from a theoretical perspective and provides a unified view of various security game models. In particular, each security game can be characterized by a set system E which consists of the defender's pure strategies; The defender's best response problem can be viewed as a combinatorial optimization problem over ϵ. Our framework captures most of the basic security game models in the literature, including all the deployed systems; The set system E arising from various domains encodes standard combinatorial problems like bipartite matching, maximum coverage, min-cost flow, packing problems, etc. Our main result shows that equilibrium computation in security games is essentially a combinatorial problem. In particular, we prove that, for any set system ϵ, the following problems can be reduced to each other in polynomial time: (0) combinatorial optimization over ϵ; (1) computing the minimax equilibrium for zero-sum security games over ϵ; (2) computing the strong Stackelberg equilibrium for security games over ϵ (3) computing the best or worst (for the defender) Nash equilibrium for security games over ϵ. Therefore, the hardness [polynomial solvability] of any of these problems implies the hardness [polynomial solvability] of all the others. Here, by ""games over ϵ"" we mean the class of security games with arbitrary payoff structures, but a fixed set ϵ of defender pure strategies.

A similar arms-race exists for tax non-compliance. The ability of individuals to exploit gaps in the ""attack surface"" of tax regulation reduces trust in governmental equity, drains money from public goods and reduces productivity. This relationship between utility-maximizing tax evaders and an increasingly resource constrained auditing system is codependent. We present a framework that allows a modest but representative area of US partnership taxation activity to be explored as an adversarial coevolutionary relationship. In this setting tax evaders try to minimize tax by exploiting loopholes in tax code inconsistencies and gaps. Reciprocally, auditors, with constrained resources, try to pinpoint strategies that shelter evasion. The framework relies upon a) a representation of the relevant partnership tax law b) a simulation of the auditing, tax calculation and compliance checking processes and c) co-optimizing taxpayer and auditor behavior via dual genetic algorithms that in turn model their coevolutionary dynamics. © 2016 ACM.",Coevolution; Genetic algorithm; Tax evasion,Algorithms; Compliance control; Evolutionary algorithms; Genetic algorithms; Auditing systems; Co-evolution; Co-evolutionary; Coevolutionary dynamics; Compliance checking; Constrained resources; Tax calculation; Tax evasions; Taxation,,,,,"Allingham, M.G., Sandmo, A., Income tax evasion: A theoretical analysis (1972) Journal of Public Economics, 1 (3-4), pp. 323-338; Bloomquist, K., Tax compliance as an evolutionary coordination game: An agent-based approach (2011) Public Finance Review, 39 (1), pp. 25-49; Checkoway, S., Shacham, H., (2010) Escape from Return-oriented Programming: Return-oriented Programming Without Returns (on the x86), , Technical Report CS2010-0954 UC San Diego, Feb; Colbaugh, R., Glass, K., Moving target defense for adaptive adversaries (2013) Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI), 2013 IEEE International Conference on, pp. 50-55. , IEEE; Dalvi, N., Domingos, P., Sanghai, S., Verma, D., Adversarial classification (2004) Proceedings of the Tenth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 99-108. , ACM; De Jong, E.D., Stanley, K.O., Wiegand, R.P., Introductory tutorial on coevolution (2007) GECCO (Companion), pp. 3133-3157; DeBarr, D., Eyler-Walker, Z., Closing the gap: Automated screening of tax returns to identify egregious tax shelters (2006) ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, 8 (1), pp. 11-16; Ficici, S.G., Bucci, A., Advanced tutorial on coevolution (2007) GECCO (Companion), pp. 3172-3204; (2013), http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8VDUStvxMY, GAO Gao-14-453; (2014), http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/663185.pdf; (2014), http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/661772.pdf; Haddadi, F., Zincir-Heywood, A.N., Botnet detection system analysis on the ffect of botnet evolution and feature representation (2015) Proceedings of the Companion Publication of the 2015 on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, pp. 893-900. , ACM; Hillis, W.D., Co-evolving parasites improve simulated evolution as an optimization procedure (1990) Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena, 42 (1), pp. 228-234; Kayack, H.G., Zincir-Heywood, A.N., Heywood, M.I., Can a good offense be a good defense?

However, when operating in an adversarial environment, the system has to be robust against presentation attacks such as spoofing. An effective solution to reduce the impact of spoofing attack is to consider both the matching score and liveness score when making the accept/reject decision. In this paper, we consider the joint decision space of matching and liveness scores in the presence of both spoofing attack and zero-effort attack, with application to signature verification. Our investigation aims to understand how decision thresholds in the above space should be optimized. This leads to two dichotomies of methods, namely brute-force approach versus probabilistic approach; and single threshold versus double-threshold approach. This view leads to three novel methods that have never been reported. Based on the experimental results carried out on an off-line signature database, the novel methods turn out to outperform simpler methods with only matching score. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, despite its ample theoretical foundation, the transition to practical implementations of physical-layer security still lacks success. A close inspection of proven vulnerable physical-layer security designs reveals that the aws are usually overlooked when the scheme is only evaluated against an inferior, single-antenna eavesdropper. Meanwhile, the attacks exposing vulnerabilities often lack theoretical justification. To reduce the gap between theory and practice, we posit that a physicalayer security scheme must be studied under multiple adversarial models to fully grasp its security strength. In this regard, we evaluate a specific physical-layer security scheme, i.e. orthogonal blinding, under multiple eavesdropper settings. We further propose a practical ""ciphertext-only attack"" that allows eavesdroppers to recover the original message by exploiting the low entropy fields in wireless packets. By means of simulation, we are able to reduce the symbol error rate (SER) at an eavesdropper below 1% using only the eavesdropper's receiving data and a general knowledge about the format of the wireless packets. © 2016 ACM.",Ciphertext-only attack; Cryptanalysis; Information-theoretic security analysis; Orthogonal blinding; Physical-layer security,Cryptography; Information theory; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network layers; Security of data; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Ciphertext-only attacks; Cryptanalysis; Information- theoretic securities; Orthogonal blinding; Physical layer security; Network security,,,,,"Zhou, X., Song, L., Zhang, Y., (2013) Physical Layer Security in Wireless Communications, , Crc Press; Gollakota, S., They can hear your heartbeats: Non-invasive security for implantable medical devices (2011) ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communi-cation Review, 41 (4), pp. 2-13; Gollakota, S., Katabi, D., Physical layer wireless security made fast and channel independent (2011) INFOCOM, 2011 Proceedings IEEE.

While there is a wide consensus that the logically centralized SDN controller should be physically distributed, today, we do not have a good understanding of how to design such a distributed and robust control plane. This is problematic, given the potentially large influence an SDN controller has on the network state compared to the distributed legacy protocols: the control plane can be an attractive target for a malicious attack. This paper initiates the study of distributed SDN control planes which are resilient to malicious controllers, for example controllers which have been compromised by a cyber attack. We introduce an adversarial control plane model and observe that approaches based on redundancy or threshold cryptography are insufficient, as incomplete or out-dated information about the network state introduces vulnerabilities. The approach presented in this paper is based on the insight that a control plane resilient to malicious behavior requires a basic notion of memory, and must be history-aware. In particular, we propose an in band approach, implemented on the SDN switch, to efficiently coordinate the different controller actions, and guarantee correct network updates even in the presence of malicious behavior. In our approach, the switch maintains a digest of the controller state and history, and only implements the update after verifying that a majority of controllers agree to the change. Our solution is not only robust but also, compared to existing consensus protocols such as Paxos, light-weight. © 2016 IEEE.",distributed control plane; SDN; security,Network security; Robust control; Consensus protocols; Controller state; Distributed control planes; Legacy protocol; Malicious attack; Malicious behavior; security; Threshold cryptography; Controllers,,,,,"Berde, P., Gerola, M., Hart, J., Higuchi, Y., Kobayashi, M., Koide, T., Lantz, B., Parulkar, G., ONOS: Towards an open, distributed SDN OS (2014) Proc.

Second, we develop a network based on the hypercube that maintains connectivity under adversarial DoS-attacks. For the DoS-attacks we use the notion of a Ω(log log n)-late adversary which only has access to topological information that is at least Ω(log log n) rounds old. Finally, we develop a network that combines both churn- and DoS-resistance. The networks gain their robustness through constant network reconfiguration, i.e., the topology of the networks changes constantly. Our reconfiguration algorithms are based on node sampling primitives for expanders and hypercubes that allow each node to sample a logarithmic number of nodes uniformly at random in O(log log n) communication rounds. These primitives are specific to overlay networks and their optimal runtime represents an exponential improvement over known techniques.

Among them, active black hole attack is a typical one. Most existing defense schemes postulated that active black hole attackers have no knowledge about the internal prevention mechanisms of MANETs. However, due to the open and self-organized nature of MANET, it is necessary to assume that all nodes, including attackers, know how the security mechanism works. In this paper, we propose a distributed self-checking scheme that can effectively prevent various forms of active black hole attackers. Even the internal attackers who know the security mechanism cannot get any benefit to launch those attacks. Simulation results affirm that our proposed solution is robust and able to improve the packet delivery ratio significantly in an adversarial MANET environment as compared with other routing schemes. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Active black hole;

Gradually, higher levels of autonomy are being incorporated into cyber-physical systems (CPS) and Internet-of-things (IoT) devices. However, safety and security has always been a lurking fear behind adoption of autonomous systems such as self-driving vehicles. To address these issues, we develop a framework for quantifying trust in autonomous system. This framework consist of an estimation method, which considers effect of adversarial attacks on sensor measurements. Our estimation algorithm uses a set-membership method during identification of safe states of the system. An important feature of this algorithm is that it can distinguish between adversarial noise and other disturbances. We also verify the autonomous system by first modeling it as networks of priced timed automata (NPTA) with stochastic semantics and then using statistical probabilistic model checking to verify it against probabilistic specifications. The verification process ensures that the autonomous system behave in accordance to safety specifications within a probabilistic threshold.

The presence of an adversary component conflicts with the stationary data assumption that is a common assumption in most machine learning methods. Since machine learning methods are not inherently adversary-Aware, it necessitates to investigate security evaluation of machine learning based detection systems in the adversarial environment. Research in adversarial environment mostly focused on modeling adversarial attacks and evaluating impact of them on learning algorithms, only few studies have devised learning algorithms with improved security.

Most of these systems expose virtualized resources of different types and sizes. As instances share the same physical host to increase utilization, they contend on hardware resources, e.g., last-level cache, making them vulnerable to side-channel attacks from co-scheduled applications. In this work we show that using data mining techniques can help an adversarial user of the cloud determine the nature and characteristics of co-scheduled applications and negatively impact their performance through targeted contention injections. We design Bolt, a simple runtime that extracts the sensitivity of co-scheduled applications to various types of interference and uses this signal to determine the type of these applications by applying a set of data mining techniques. We validate the accuracy of Bolt on a 39-server cluster. Bolt correctly identifies the type and characteristics of 81 percent out of 108 victim applications, and constructs specialized contention signals that degrade their performance. We also use Bolt to find the most commonly-run applications on EC2. We hope that underlining such security vulnerabilities in modern cloud facilities will encourage cloud providers to introduce stronger resource isolation primitives in their systems. © 2002-2011 IEEE.",application studies resulting in better multiple-processor systems; scheduling and task partitioning; security and privacy protection; Super (very large) computers,Bolts; Scheduling; Side channel attack; Application studies resulting in better multiple-processor systems; Resource flexibility; Scheduling and task partitioning; Security and privacy protection; Security implications; Security vulnerabilities; Super (very large) computer; Virtualized resources; Data mining,,,,,"Liu, F., Ren, L., Bai, H., Mitigating cross-VM side channel attack on multiple tenants cloud platform (2014) J.

The goal is to design a distributed algorithm that informs nodes which choice is in majority. In this study, the authors formulate this problem as a hypothesis testing problem and propose fixed-size and sequential solutions using classical and Bayesian approaches. In the sequential version, the proposed mechanism enables nodes to test which choice is in majority, successively in time. Hence, termination of the algorithm is embedded within it, contrary to the existing approaches which require a monitoring algorithm to indicate the termination. This property makes the algorithm more efficient in terms of message complexity. Furthermore, the authors show that the proposed solution is resilient to Byzantine attacks if network connectivity is F + 1 in the presence of F adversarial nodes. Thus, the proposed algorithm is more robust compared with the previous works which are vulnerable to the existence of adversarial nodes. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2016.",,Bayesian networks; Bins; Complex networks; Statistical tests; Bayesian approaches; Byzantine attacks; Exponential distributions; Fixed size; Hypothesis testing; Message complexity; Monitoring algorithms; Network connectivity; Algorithms,,,,,"Ruan, Y., Mostofi, Y., Binary consensus with soft information processing in cooperative networks (2008) 47th IEEE Conf. on Decision and Control, pp. 3613-3619. , CDC 2008. 2008; Rhim, J.B., Goyal, V.K., Distributed hypothesis testing with social learning and symmetric fusion (2014) IEEE Trans.

The distributed search-attack mission self-organization algorithm (SAMSOA) divides the global optimization problem into some local optimization problems. Each UAV is considered as a subsystem and is assigned a separate processor to solve its local optimization problem. Meanwhile, the information exchange between UAVs can help each subsystem make the optimal decision for the multiple UAVs system. The SAMSOA algorithm consists of a normal flight mode and a threat avoidance mode. In the normal flight mode, the search-attack mission is modeled to maximize the surveillance coverage rate and minimize the targets' existence time. Then, the improved distributed ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is designed to generate path points. Finally, a Dubins curve is used to connect the path points smoothly. In the threat avoidance mode, the path of avoiding a threat is generated based on Dubins curve. A series of simulations are carried out to verify the online application of the proposed SAMSOA algorithm. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.",,Antennas; Artificial intelligence; Distributed computer systems; Global optimization; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Adversarial environments; Distributed search; Global optimization problems; Information exchanges; Local optimizations; On-line applications; Self organization algorithm; Self organizations; Ant colony optimization,,,,,"(2011) Unmanned Systems Integrated Roadmap FY2011-2036, pp. 7-43. , Department of Defense USA; Lu, J., Jain, L.C., Zhang, G., (2012) Handbook on Decision Making ISRL, 33, pp. 417-428. , pringer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg; Sunghun, J., Kartik, B., Enabling operational autonomy for unmanned aerial vehicles with scalability (2013) J.

In our model, there exists an adversarial reader who is able to transmit its own continuous wave signal outside the frequency band of the legitimate reader. Due to the fact that under backscatter modulation, the tag cannot distinguish different frequencies and simply sets the impedance in its circuitry to either low or high to reflect a bit of 1 or 0, and the adversarial reader's received signal is a weighted sum of the response to both its own signal and the legitimate reader's signal. Using this model, we provide a theoretical analysis of the capability of the adversarial reader in terms of the decoding error probability for slow frequency and fast frequency hopping systems. We derive analytic formulas and conduct experiments using software defined radios that act as the legitimate reader, the adversarial reader, and Intel Wireless Identification Sensing Platform tags with parameters as specified in EPC Gen2. Simulations are also used to validate our findings. We find from the theoretical analysis as well the experimental results that the active eavesdropper can achieve a better decoding error rate than a conventional passive eavesdropper, even in the case that the eavesdropper's signal is a low power signal. © 2015 IEEE.",active eavesdropping attack; Error probability; RFID; security analysis; SFH and FFH spread spectrum,Decoding; Errors; Frequency bands; Frequency hopping; Radio communication; Security systems; Software radio; Spectroscopy; Active eavesdropping; Error probabilities; Frequency hopping spread spectrum; Passive radio frequency identification systems; Security analysis; Software-defined radios; Spread spectra; Wireless identifications; Radio frequency identification (RFID),,,,,"Aagaard, M.D., Gong, G., Mota, R.K., Hardware implementations of the WG-5 cipher for passive RFID tags (2013) Proc IEEE Int.

One of the major security concerns of the outsourcing paradigm is how to protect sensitive information in the outsourced dataset. In general, the sensitive information can be protected by encryption. However, data dependency constraints in the outsourced data may serve as adversary knowledge and bring security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we focus on functional dependency (FD), an important type of data dependency constraints, and study the security threats by the adversarial FDs. We design the practical scheme that can defend against the FD attack by encrypting a small amount of non-sensitive data (encryption overhead). We prove that searching for the scheme that leads to the optimal encryption overhead is NP-complete, and design efficient heuristic algorithms. We conduct an extensive set of experiments on two real-world datasets. The experiment results show that our heuristic approach brings small amounts of encryption overhead (at most 1% more than the optimal overhead), and enjoys a ten times speedup compared with the optimal solution. Besides, our approach can reduce up to 90% of the encryption overhead of the-state-of-art solution. © 2016 IEEE.",cloud computing; data security; functional dependency,Cloud computing; Cryptography; Finite difference method; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Human computer interaction; Information management; Optimization; Outsourcing; Security of data; Data dependency constraints; Functional dependency; Heuristic approach; Non-sensitive data; Real-world datasets; Security vulnerabilities; Sensitive informations; Third-party service providers; Big data,,,,,"Batini, C., Lenzerini, M., Navathe, S.B., A comparative analysis of methodologies for database schema integration (1986) ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR); Bohannon, P., Fan, W., Geerts, F., Jia, X., Kementsietsidis, A., Conditional functional dependencies for data cleaning (2007) ICDE; Brodsky, A., Farkas, C., Jajodia, S., Secure databases: Constraints, inference channels, and monitoring disclosures (2000) TKDE; Chiticariu, L., Hernández, M.A., Kolaitis, P.G., Popa, L., Semiautomatic schema integration in clio (2007) VLDB; Cormode, G., Golab, L., Flip, K., McGregor, A., Srivastava, D., Zhang, X., Estimating the confidence of conditional functional dependencies (2009) SIGMOD; Fan, W., Geerts, F., Li, J., Xiong, M., Discovering conditional functional dependencies (2011) TKDE, 23 (5), pp. 683-698; Goguen, J.A., Meseguer, J., Unwinding and inference control (1984) IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 75-87; Hacigümüs, H., Mehrotra, S., Iyer, B.R., Providing database as a service (2002) ICDE; Li, Y., Dai, W., Ming, Z., Qiu, M., Privacy protection for preventing data over-collection in smart city (2015) IEEE Transactions on Computers; Miller, R.J., Ioannidis, Y.E., Ramakrishnan, R., The use of information capacity in schema integration and translation (1993) VLDB, 93; Morgenstern, M., Controlling logical inference in multilevel database systems (1988) IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy; Qiu, M., Zhong, M., Li, J., Gai, K., Zong, Z., Phase-change memory optimization for green cloud with genetic algorithm (2015) IEEE Transactions on Computers; Smart, N.P., Vercauteren, F., Fully homomorphic encryption with relatively small key and ciphertext sizes (2010) Public Key Cryptography (PKC), pp. 420-443; Song, D.X., Wagner, D., Perrig, A., Practical techniques for searches on encrypted data (2000) Proceedings of IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 44-55; Stachour, P.D., Thuraisingham, B.M., (1990) Design of Ldv: A Multilevel Secure Relational Database Management System, pp. 190-209; Su, T.-A., Ozsoyoglu, G., Controlling fd and mvd inferences in multilevel relational database systems (1991) TKDE, 3 (4); Sweeney, L., Achieving k-anonymity privacy protection using generalization and suppression (2002) International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems, 10 (5), pp. 571-588; Wang, H., Liu, R., Privacy-preserving publishing microdata with full functional dependencies (2011) Data & Knowledge Engineering, 70 (3), pp. 249-268",,Qiu M.,Columbia University;et al.;IEEE;IEEE Computer Society;IEEE TCSC;Pace University,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2nd IEEE International Conference on Big Data Security on Cloud, IEEE BigDataSecurity 2016, 2nd IEEE International Conference on High Performance and Smart Computing, IEEE HPSC 2016 and IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Data and Security, IEEE IDS 2016",9 April 2016 through 10 April 2016,,122491,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

No adversary can remove the mark without damaging the functionality of the program. In this work, we study the problem of watermarking various cryptographic programs such as pseudorandom function (PRF) evaluation, decryption, and signing. For example, given a PRF key K, we create a marked program C∼ that evaluates the PRF F(K, ·). An adversary that gets C∼ cannot come up with any program C∗ in which the mark is removed but which still evaluates the PRF correctly on even a small fraction of the inputs. The work of Barak, Goldreich, Impagliazzo, Rudich, Sahai, Vadhan, and Yang (CRYPTO'01 and Journal of ACM 59(2)) shows that, assuming indistinguishability obfuscation (iO), such watermarking is impossible if the marked program C∼ evaluates the original program with perfect correctness. In this work we show that, assuming iO, such watermarking is possible if the marked program C∼ is allowed to err with even a negligible probability, which would be undetectable to the user. Our watermarking schemes are public key, namely we use a secret marking key to embed marks in programs, and a public detection key that allows anyone to detect marks in programs. Our schemes are secure against chosen program attacks, that is even if the adversary is given oracle access to the marking functionality. We emphasize that our security notion of watermark non-removability considers arbitrary adversarial strategies to modify the marked program, in contrast to the prior works (Nishimaki, EUROCRYPT'13). © 2016 ACM. 978-1-4503-4132-5/16/06...$15.00.",Indistinguishability obfuscation; Pseudorandom functions; Watermarking,Computation theory; Cryptography; Digital watermarking; Watermarking; Indistinguishability; Oracle access; Program attacks; Pseudo-random functions; Public detection; Public keys; Security notion; Watermarking schemes; C (programming language),,,,,"Adelsbach, A., Katzenbeisser, S., Veith, H., Watermarking schemes provably secure against copy and ambiguity attacks (2003) Proceedings of the 2003 ACM Workshop on Digital Rights Management 2003, pp. 111-119. , Moti Yung, editor, Washington, DC, USA, October 27, 2003, ACM; Banerjee, A., Fuchsbauer, G., Peikert, C., Pietrzak, K., Stevens, S., Key-homomorphic Constrained Pseudorandom Functions, pp. 31-60. , Dodis and Nielsen DN15; Barak, B., Goldreich, O., Impagliazzo, R., Rudich, S., Sahai, A., Vadhan, S.P., Yang, K., On the (im) possibility of obfuscating programs (2001) Advances in Cryptology - CRYPTO 2001, 21st Annual International Cryptology Conference, pp. 1-18. , Santa Barbara, California, USA, August 19-23, 2001, Proceedings; Barak, B., Goldreich, O., Impagliazzo, R., Rudich, S., Sahai, A., Vadhan, S.P., Yang, K., On the (im) possibility of obfuscating programs (2012) J.

At any time instant, the designer aims to operate the network in an optimal topology within this policy compliant sequence with respect to a desired network property. Simultaneously, the adversary counters the designer trying to force operation in a suboptimal topology. We show the existence of various mixed strategy equilibria in this game and systematically study its structural properties. We study the effect of parameters, and characterize the steady state behavior of the underlying Markov chain. While the intuitive adversarial strategy here is to attack links appearing early in the topology sequence, the Nash Equilibrium strategy is for the designer to defend the earlier links and for the adversary to attack the later links. We validate these properties through two use cases with example sets of network topologies. © 2016 IEEE.",,Design; Markov processes; Mobile ad hoc networks; Topology; Wireless networks; Effect of parameters; Nash equilibrium strategies; Network properties; Network topology; Network topology designs; Optimal topologies; Steady-state behaviors; Topology design; Wireless ad hoc networks,,,,,"Watanabe, T., Nakamura, A., Edge-connectivity augmentation problems (1987) Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 35 (1), pp. 96-144; Demaine, E.D., Zadimoghaddam, M., Minimizing the diameter of a network using shortcut edges (2010) SWAT Volume 6139 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pp. 420-431. , Springer; Meyerson, A., Tagiku, B., Minimizing average shortest path distances via shortcut edge addition (2009) APPROX-RANDOM Volume 5687 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pp. 272-285. , Springer; Basu, P., Chau, C.-K., Gibbens, R., Guha, S., Irwin, R., Multicasting under multi-domain and hierarchical constraints (2013) Proceedings of WiOpt 2013; Fabrikant, A., Luthra, A., Maneva, E., Papadimitriou, C.H., Shenker, S., On a network creation game (2003) Proceedings of the Twentysecond Annual Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing, PODC '03, pp. 347-351. , ACM; Van Dijk, M., Juels, A., Oprea, A., Rivest, R.L., Flipit: The game of ""stealthy takeover"" (2013) J.

By adding to the input object an imperceptible amount of adversarial noise, it is highly likely that the classifier can be tricked into assigning the modified object to any desired class. Furthermore, these adversarial samples generalize well across models: samples generated using one network can often succeed in fooling other networks or machine learning models. These alarming properties of adversarial samples have drawn increasing interest recently, with several researchers having attributed the adversarial effect to different factors, such as the high dimensionality of the data or the overlylinear nature of modern neural networks. Nevertheless, a complete picture of the cause of adversarial samples has not yet emerged. Towards this goal, we present a novel theoretical result that formally links the adversarial vulnerability of learning to the intrinsic dimensionality of the data. In particular, our investigation formally establishes that as the local intrinsic dimensionality (LID) increases, 1-NN classifiers become increasingly prone to being subverted. We show that in expectation, a k-nearest neighbor of a test point can be transformed into its 1-nearest neighbor by adding an amount of noise that diminishes as the LID increases. We also provide an experimental validation of the impact of LID on adversarial perturbation for both synthetic and real data, and discuss the implications of our result for general classifiers. © Copyright 2016 by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.",,Artificial intelligence; Nearest neighbor search; 1-nearest neighbor; Deep neural networks; Experimental validations; High dimensionality; Intrinsic dimensionalities; K-nearest neighbors; Machine learning models; Synthetic and real data; Learning systems,,,,,"Amsaleg, L., Chelly, O., Furon, T., Girard, S., Houle, M.E., Kawarabayashi, K., Nett, M., Estimating local intrinsic dimensionality (2015) KDD, pp. 29-38; Bruske, J., Sommer, G., Intrinsic dimensionality estimation with optimally topology preserving maps (1998) IEEE Trans.

To date, the ability to perform forensic investigations on Z-Wave devices has largely been ignored; however, the placement of these devices in homes and industrial facilities makes them valuable assets for the investigation of criminal and adversarial actors. Z-Wave devices consist of sensors and actuators, which can be connected to the Internet via a gateway. Therefore, their memory contents may contain sensor reports of criminal activity or, more indirectly, provide evidence that the devices have been manipulated to achieve physical or cyber access. This paper provides details on extracting and programming the Flash and EEPROM memory of the ZW0301, which is a common Z-Wave transceiver module found on many Z-Wave devices.

From a security usability perspective, text based passwords are easy to use and familiar to users. Text based passwords however, are prone to attacks that stem from challenges that users' face with memorability. Text-based password memorability issues pose problems for service providers on platforms where identity management is a key concern. Application examples emerge in social media, online commerce, and also in the management of critical infrastructure such as smart micro-grids. A further concern is that, large volumes of sensitive information are made available and shared on these applications and so constitute an attractive target for obtaining data in adversarial ways in order to provoke impersonation and inferential attacks, for instance. In this paper, we discuss the pros and cons of using graphical passwords instead of text-based passwords on information sharing platforms. We support our discussion by considering two graphical password schemes based on the principles of recall and cued-recall respectively which are philosophically similar to text-based passwords. Results from our proof-of-concept implementation indicate that, in comparison to text-based and recall graphical passwords, cued-recall graphical passwords are a better authentication mechanism in terms of memorability and password security. © 2016 IEEE.",Access Control; Authentication; Data Sharing; Graphical Passwords; Text based passwords,Access control; Information analysis; Information dissemination; Information management; Authentication mechanisms; Collaborative information; Data Sharing; Graphical password; Information sharing platforms; Security usabilities; Sensitive informations; Text based passwords; Authentication,,,,,"Chiasson, S., Forget, A., Stobert, E., Van Oorschot, P.C., Biddle, R., Multiple password interference in text passwords and click-based graphical passwords (2009) Proceedings of the 16th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 500-511. , ser.

Supporting micro-grids with computationally limited devices, is a cost-effective approach to service provisioning in resource-limited settings. However, the limited availability of real time measurements and the unreliable communication network makes the use of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) for monitoring and control a challenging problem. Grid operation and stability are therefore reliant on inaccurate and incomplete information. Consequently, data gathering and analytics raise privacy concerns for grid users, which is undesirable. In this paper, we study adversarial scenarios for the privacy violations on micro-grids. We consider two types of privacy threats in constrained micro-grids, namely inferential and aggregation attacks. The reason is that both attacks capture scenarios that can be used to provoke energy theft and destabilize the grid. Grid destabilzation leads to distrust between suppliers and consumers. This work provides a roadmap towards a secure and resilient smart micro-grid energy networks. © 2016 IEEE.",Aggregation attack; Inference attack; Micro-grid; Privacy,Advanced metering infrastructures; Cost effectiveness; Data privacy; Cost-effective approach; Incomplete information; Inference attacks; Micro grid; Monitoring and control; Real time measurements; Service provisioning; Smart Micro Grids; Smart power grids,,,,,"World energy outlook 2013 (2013) OECD/IEA, , (IEA); (2011) Technology Roadmap Smart Grids, , Paris; Chowdhury, S., Crossley, P., (2009) Microgrids and Active Distribution Networks, , ser.

In node capture attacks, the adversary physically captures sensors and extracts all information including key information from their memories, trying to compromise the system's security protection. However, the robust and random nature of many WSN security designs makes it difficult to compromise the system even with the capture of some sensors. In this paper, we approach WSN security from an adversarial point of view and investigate low-cost and efficient algorithms to identify sensors in a WSN in the shortest time with the lowest cost. Instead of randomly capturing sensors, an intelligent attacker should choose the next target based on the known topology so far. Because the identification of such has been proven to be NP-hard (non-deterministic polynomial-time hard), we propose to transform the problem into a set covering problem and develop a greedy minimum cost node capture attack algorithm (MCA) to lower cost of attack. Extensive simulations have been implemented to evaluate the performance of MCA and to compare it with several related schemes. It is shown that MCA lowers the cost of compromising WSNs by 16%. © Copyright 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",attacking efficiency; energy cost; node capture attack; wireless sensor networks,Algorithms;

In this environment, hardware Trojans (i.e., malicious modifications or inclusions made by untrusted third parties) pose major security concerns, especially for those integrated circuits (ICs) and systems used in critical applications and cyber infrastructure. While hardware Trojans have been explored significantly in academia over the last decade, there remains room for improvement. In this article, we examine the research on hardware Trojans from the last decade and attempt to capture the lessons learned. A comprehensive adversarial model taxonomy is introduced and used to examine the current state of the art. Then the past countermeasures and publication trends are categorized based on the adversarial model and topic. Through this analysis, we identify what has been covered and the important problems that are underinvestigated. We also identify the most critical lessons for those new to the field and suggest a roadmap for future hardware Trojan research. © 2016 ACM.",Attack model; Countermeasures; Hardware security and trust;

MapReduce is extensively used daily around the world as an efficient distributed computation tool for a large class of problems, e.g., search, clustering, log analysis, different types of join operations, matrix multiplication, pattern matching, and analysis of social networks. Security and privacy of data and MapReduce computations are essential concerns when a MapReduce computation is executed in public or hybrid clouds. In order to execute a MapReduce job in public and hybrid clouds, authentication of mappers–reducers, confidentiality of data-computations, integrity of data-computations, and correctness–freshness of the outputs are required. Satisfying these requirements shields the operation from several types of attacks on data and MapReduce computations. In this paper, we investigate and discuss security and privacy challenges and requirements, considering a variety of adversarial capabilities, and characteristics in the scope of MapReduce. We also provide a review of existing security and privacy protocols for MapReduce and discuss their overhead issues. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Cloud computing; Distributed computing; Hadoop; HDFS; Hybrid cloud; MapReduce algorithms; Privacy; Private cloud; Public cloud; Security,Cloud computing; Computer privacy; Data privacy; Pattern matching; Security of data; Hadoop; HDFS; Hybrid clouds; Map-reduce; Private clouds; Public clouds; Security; Distributed computer systems,,,,,"Mell, P., Grance, T., The NIST definition of cloud computing (2011); Buyya, R., Broberg, J., Goscinski, A.M., Cloud computing: Principles and paradigms, Vol. 87 (2010), John Wiley & Sons; Zhang, Q., Cheng, L., Boutaba, R., Cloud computing: state-of-the-art and research challenges (2010) J.

In this paper, we propose an online learning algorithm for adaptive channel access of wireless communications in unknown environments based on the theory of multiarmed bandits (MAB) problems. By automatically tuning two control parameters, i.e., learning rate and exploration probability, our algorithms could find the optimal channel access strategies and achieve the almost optimal learning performance over time in different scenarios. The quantitative performance studies indicate the superior throughput gain when compared with previous solutions and the flexibility of our algorithm in practice, which is resilient to both oblivious and adaptive jamming attacks with different intelligence and attacking strength that ranges from no-attack to the full-attack of all spectrum resources. We conduct extensive simulations to validate our theoretical analysis. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",jamming attack; Online learning; security; stochastic and adversarial bandits; wireless communications,E-learning; Jamming; Stochastic systems; Wireless telecommunication systems; Jamming attacks; Online learning; security; stochastic and adversarial bandits; Wireless communications; Learning algorithms,,,,,"Bubeck, S., Cesa-Bianchi, N., Regret analysis of stochastic, and nonstochastic multi-Armed bandit problems (2012) Foundation, and Trends in Machine Learning, 5. , http://www.nowpublishers.com/MAL, [Online].

Such channels fall in the framework of arbitrarily varying channels (AVCs), for which it has been shown that the classical deterministic approaches with pre-specified encoder and decoder fail if the AVC is symmetrizable. However, more sophisticated strategies such as common randomness (CR) assisted codes or list decoding are capable to resolve the ambiguity induced by symmetrizable AVCs. AVCs further serve as the indispensable basis for modeling adversarial attacks such as jamming in information theoretic security related communication problems. In this paper, we study the arbitrarily varying multiple access channel (AVMAC) with conferencing encoders, which models the communication scenario with two cooperating transmitters and one receiver. This can be motivated for example by cooperating base stations or access points in future systems. The capacity region of the AVMAC with conferencing encoders is established and it is shown that list decoding allows for reliable communication also for symmetrizable AVMACs. The list capacity region equals the CR-assisted capacity region for large enough list size. Finally, for fixed probability of decoding error the amount of resources, i.e., CR or list size, is quantified and shown to be finite. © 2016 AIMS.",Arbitrarily varying multiple access channel; Capacity region; Conferencing encoders; Coordination resources; Derandomization; List decoding,,,,,,"Ahlswede, R., Elimination of correlation in random codes for arbitrarily carying channels (1978) Z.

In the recent years, cognitive radio (CR) technology has gained attention as an attractive approach to alleviate spectrum congestion. A cognitive radio transceiver can operate over a wide range of frequencies possibly spanning multiple frequency bands. A cognitive radio node can opportunistically utilize unused wireless spectrum without interference from other wireless devices in its vicinity. Due to spatial variations in frequency usage and hardware variations in radio transceivers, different nodes in the network may perceive different subsets of frequencies available to them for communication. This heterogeneity in the available channel sets across the network increases the complexity of solving the neighbor discovery problem in a cognitive radio network. In this work, we design and analyze several randomized algorithms for neighbor discovery in such a (heterogeneous) network under a variety of assumptions (e.g., maximum node degree known or unknown) for both synchronous and asynchronous systems under minimal knowledge. We also show that our randomized algorithms are naturally suited to tolerate unreliable channels and adversarial attacks. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This is important to preserve reasonable acceptance rate of genuine queries and the overall feasibility of the recognition system. However, such acceptance of multiple similar measurements decreases the imposter's difficulty of obtaining a system-acceptable measurement, thus resulting in a degraded security level. This deteriorated security needs to be measurable to provide truthful security assurance to the users. Entropy is a standard measure of security. However, the entropy formula is applicable only when there is a single acceptable possibility. In this paper, we develop an entropy-measuring model for biometric systems that accepts multiple similar measurements per user. Based on the idea of guessing entropy, the proposed model quantifies biometric system security in terms of adversarial guessing effort for two practical attacks. Excellent agreement between analytic and experimental simulation-based measurement results on a synthetic and a benchmark face dataset justify the correctness of our model and thus the feasibility of the proposed entropy-measuring approach. © 2013 IEEE.",Biometric system; entropy measurement; guessing; security,Entropy; Mobile security; Biometric measurements; Biometric systems; Biometric verification; Entropy measurement; Experimental simulations; Measuring model; Recognition systems; Security assurance; Biometrics,,,,,"Adler, A., Youmaran, R., Loyka, S., Towards a measure of biometric feature information (2009) Pattern Anal.

Machine learning algorithms have been shown to be vulnerable to covert, strategic attacks through the manipulation of training data. Machine learning algorithms in pervasive systems frequently train on data that could be manipulated by a malicious 3rd party. In this paper, we present our ongoing work to develop a security mechanism that is designed to work in the dynamic environments of pervasive computing as opposed to traditional security mechanisms that are designed for static environments. Furthermore, we present our modular testing framework that will be used to rapidly compare our work with other security mechanisms, applications and adversarial models. © 2016 IEEE.",,Artificial intelligence; Dynamics; Learning systems; Middleware; Ubiquitous computing; Dynamic environments; Modular testing; On-machines; Pervasive systems; Security mechanism; Static environment; Training data; User experience; Learning algorithms,,,,,"Anagnostopoulos, T., Anagnostopoulos, C., Hadjiefthymiades, S., Kyriakakos, M., Kalousis, A., Predicting the location of mobile users: A machine learning approach (2009) Proceedings of the 2009 International Conference on Pervasive Services, ICPS '09, pp. 65-72. , New York, NY, USA,.

Player 1 (defender) routes flow through a network to maximize her value of effective flow while facing transportation costs. Player 2 (attacker) simultaneously disrupts one or more links to maximize her value of lost flow but also faces cost of disrupting links. This game is strategically equivalent to a zero-sum game. Linear programming duality and the max-flow min-cut theorem are applied to obtain properties that are satisfied in any mixed Nash equilibrium. In any equilibrium, both players achieve identical payoffs. While the defender's expected transportation cost decreases in attacker's marginal value of lost flow, the attacker's expected cost of attack increases in defender's marginal value of effective flow. Interestingly, the expected amount of effective flow decreases in both these parameters. These results can be viewed as a generalization of the classical max-flow with minimum transportation cost problem to adversarial environments. © 2015 IEEE.",,Computation theory; Costs; Game theory; Linear programming; Transportation; Transportation routes; Adversarial environments; Expected costs; Linear programming duality; Marginal values; Max-flow min-cut theorems; Nash equilibria; Strategic game; Transportation cost; Network routing,,,,,"Wood, R.K., Deterministic network interdiction (1993) Mathematical and Computer Modelling, 17 (2), pp. 1-18; Cormican, K.J., Morton, D.P., Wood, R.K., Stochastic network interdiction (1998) Operations Research, 46 (2); Bertsimas, D., Nasrabadi, E., Stiller, S., Robust and adaptive network flows (2013) Operations Research, 61 (5), pp. 1218-1242; Gueye, A., Walrand, J.C., Anantharam, V., Design of network topology in an adversarial environment (2010) Decision and Game Theory for Security-First International Conference, GameSec 2010, 6442, pp. 1-20. , Berlin, Germany, November 22-23, 2010.

In addition, several evasion techniques, such as code obfuscation and environment-dependent redirection, are used in combination with drive-by download attacks to prevent detection. In environment-dependent redirection, attackers profile the information on the user's environment, such as the name and version of the browser and browser plugins, and launch a drive-by download attack on only certain targets by changing the destination URL. When malicious content detection and collection techniques, such as honeyclients, are used that do not match the specific environment of the attack target, they cannot detect the attack because they are not redirected. Therefore, it is necessary to improve analysis coverage while countering these adversarial evasion techniques. We propose a method for exhaustively analyzing JavaScript code relevant to redirections and extracting the destination URLs in the code. Our method facilitates the detection of attacks by extracting a large number of URLs while controlling the analysis overhead by excluding code not relevant to redirections. We implemented our method in a browser emulator called MineSpider that automatically extracts potential URLs from websites. We validated it by using communication data with malicious websites captured during a three-year period. The experimental results demonstrated that MineSpider extracted 30,000 new URLs from malicious websites in a few seconds that conventional methods missed.

Ingegneria dell Informazione, University of Padova, Padova, 35131, Italy","In wireless networks, users share a transmission medium. For efficient channel use, wireless systems often use a Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol to perform channel coordination by having each node announce its usage intentions and other nodes avoid making conflicting transmissions. Traditionally, such announcements are made on a common control channel. However, this control channel is vulnerable to jamming because its location is pre-assigned and known to attackers. Furthermore, the announcements themselves provide information useful for jamming. We focus on a situation where transmitters share spectrum in the presence of intelligent and insider jammers capable of adaptively changing their jamming patterns. Despite the complex threat model, we propose a simple MAC scheme, called SimpleMAC, that effectively counters network compromise and MAC-aware jamming attacks. We then study the optimal adversarial behavior and analyze the performance of the proposed scheme theoretically, through Monte Carlo simulations, and by implementation on the WARP software-defined radio platform. In comparison to the Nash equilibrium alternative of disabling the MAC protocol, SimpleMAC quickly attains vastly improved performance and converges to the optimal solution (over six-fold improvement in SINR and 50% gains in channel capacity in a realistic mobile scenario). © 1993-2012 IEEE.",Jamming; medium access control (MAC); network compromise; wireless network,Access control; Complex networks; Intelligent systems; Jamming; Monte Carlo methods; Software radio; Telecommunication networks; Wireless networks; Channel coordination; Common control channels; Control channels; Efficient channels; Medium access control protocols; Optimal solutions; Software-defined radios; Transmission medium; Medium access control,,,,,"(2005) IEEE Standard for Information Technology - Local and Metropolitan Area Networks - Specific Requirements - Part 15.1a: Wireless Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications for Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN), , IEEE Std 802.15.1-2005; (2007) IEEE Standard for Information Technology - Telecommunications and Information Exchange between Systems - Local AndMetropolitan Area Networks - Specific Requirements - Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications, , IEEE Std 802.11-2007; (2009) IEEE Broadband Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs), , IEEE Std 802.16-2009; Alnifie, G., Simon, R., A multi-channel defense against jamming attacks in wireless sensor networks (2007) Q2SWinet, pp. 95-104. , Oct; Awerbuch, B., Richa, A., Scheideler, C., A jamming-resistant MAC protocol for single-hop wireless networks (2008) Proc.

Most wireless protocols currently used perform well under specific environmental conditions or in particular applications. In this work, we propose a novel methodology for designing routing protocols for resource-constrained wireless multi-hop networks by separating the protocol into distinct components, which specify particular functionalities. Different QoS requirements can be guaranteed by configuring the different components without the need to modify or develop the protocol from scratch. An initial study for energy-constrained environments indicated that our approach is effective. In our ongoing work we consider adversarial environments and we develop techniques to mitigate network-layer attacks. Finally we are investigating the design of a decision-theoretic module for dynamic protocol configuration. © 2015 IEEE.",Multi-hop networks; QoS performance; Routing,Internet protocols; Network layers; Network routing; Wireless networks; Adversarial environments; Dynamic protocol configuration; Multihop networks; Performance guarantees; Qos performance; Routing; Specific environmental conditions; Wireless multi-hop network; Quality of service,,,,,"Huang, H., Baras, J.S., Component based routing: A new methodology for designing routing protocols for manet (2006) Proceedings of the 25th Army Science Conference, , Orlando, FL, November; Baras, J., Tabatabaee, V., Purkayastha, P., Somasundaram, K., Component based performance modelling of wireless routing protocols (2009) Communications, 2009.

This paper presents a general framework to study attacks on state estimation by adversaries capable of injecting bad-data into measurements and further, of jamming their reception. Through these two techniques, a novel 'detectable jamming' attack is designed that changes the state estimation despite failing bad-data detection checks. Compared to commonly studied 'hidden' data attacks, these attacks have lower costs and a wider feasible operating region. It is shown that the entire domain of jamming costs can be divided into two regions, with distinct graph-cut based formulations for the design of the optimal attack. The most significant insight arising from this result is that the adversarial capability to jam measurements changes the optimal 'detectable jamming' attack design only if the jamming cost is less than half the cost of bad-data injection. A polynomial time approximate algorithm for attack vector construction is developed and its efficacy in attack design is demonstrated through simulations on IEEE test systems. © 2015 IEEE.",data injection; detectable attack; graph-cut; jamming; phasor measurement; PMU,Costs; Graphic methods; Jamming; Phasor measurement units; Polynomial approximation; Smart power grids; State estimation; Approximate algorithms; Bad data detections; detectable attack; Entire domain; Graph cut; IEEE test systems; Operating regions; Polynomial-time; Electric power transmission networks,,,,,"Phadke, A.G., Synchronized phasor measurements in power systems (1993) IEEE Comput.

Statistical spam filters are manifest to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To evaluate security issues related to spam filtering numerous machine learning systems are used. For adversary applications some Pattern classification systems are ordinarily used, since these systems are based on classical theory and design approaches do not take into account adversarial settings. Pattern classification system display vulnerabilities (i.e. a weakness that grants an attacker to reduce assurance on system's information) to several potential attacks, allowing adversaries to attenuate their effectiveness. In this paper, security evaluation of spam email using pattern classifier during an attack is addressed which degrade the performance of the system. Additionally a model of the adversary is used that allows defining spam attack scenario. © 2015 IEEE.",adversarial classification; Pattern classification; security evaluation; spam filtering,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Computation theory; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Pattern recognition systems; Adversarial classifications; Attack scenarios; Classical theory; Classification system; Pattern classifier; Potential attack; Security evaluation; Spam filtering; Internet,,,,,"Biggio, B., Fumera, G., Roli, F., Security evaluation of pattern classifiers under attack (2014) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engg., 26 (4). , April; Johnson, P., Tan, B., Schuckers, S., Multimodal fusion vulnerability to non-zero effort (spoof) imposters (2010) Proc.

Vulnerabilities in the cloud infrastructure have been readily exploited by the adversary class. Therefore, providing the desired level of assurance to all stakeholders through safeguarding data (sensitive or otherwise) which is stored in the cloud, is of utmost importance. In addition, protecting the cloud from adversarial attacks of diverse types and intents, cannot be understated. Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDoS) attack is considered as one of the concerns that has stalled many organizations from migrating their operations and/or data to the cloud. This is because an EDoS attack targets the financial component of the service provider. In this work, we propose a novel and reactive approach based on a rate limit technique, with low overhead, to detect and mitigate EDoS attacks against cloud-based services. Through this reactive scheme, a limited access permission for cloud services is granted to each user. Experiments were conducted in a laboratory cloud setup, to evaluate the performance of the proposed mitigation technique. Results obtained show that the proposed approach is able to detect and prevent such an attack with low cost and overhead. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This is distinct from adversarial data injection that changes meter readings while preserving their utility in state estimation. This paper presents a generalized attack regime that uses jamming of secure and insecure measurements to greatly expand the scope of common 'hidden' and 'detectable' data injection attacks in literature. For 'hidden' attacks, it is shown that with jamming, the optimal attack is given by the minimum feasible cut in a specific weighted graph. More importantly, for 'detectable' data attacks, this paper shows that the entire range of relative costs for adversarial jamming and data injection can be divided into three separate regions, with distinct graph-cut based constructions for the optimal attack. Approximate algorithms for attack design are developed and their performances are demonstrated by simulations on IEEE test cases. Further, it is proved that prevention of such attacks require security of all grid measurements. This work comprehensively quantifies the dual adversarial benefits of jamming: (a) reduced attack cost and (b) increased resilience to secure measurements, that strengthen the potency of data attacks. © 2016 IEEE.",,Graphic methods; Network security; Approximate algorithms; Data attacks; Graph cut; Meter readings; Relative costs; Test case; Weighted graph; Jamming,,,,,"Phadke, A.G., Synchronized phasor measurements in power systems (1993) IEEE Comput.

One challenge for the adversary is to decide between jamming and eavesdropping. While jamming can be quite effective in preventing reliable communication of the user, it can also be quite harmful for the adversary since he/she can be detected. On the other hand, eavesdropping is quite safe for the adversary; however, it sometimes may not be so efficient compared to jamming, if the adversary cannot respond to the information gleaned from eavesdropping in a timely manner. The user can either transmit, thus becoming vulnerable to malicious activity, or be in a silent mode in turn delaying his/her transmission. However, by combining these modes properly the user can assist an intruder detection system in detecting the adversary, since transmission can provoke the adversary into a jamming attack, and a strategically allocated silent mode while the jammer continues jamming can increase the probability of detecting the adversary. In this paper, to get insight into this problem, two simple stochastic games are proposed. Explicit solutions are found that lead to the characterization of some interesting properties. In particular, it is shown that under certain conditions, incorporating in the transmission protocol a time slot dealing just with the detection of malicious threats can improve the secrecy and reliability of the communication without extra transmission delay. © 2015 IEEE.",eavesdropping; Jamming; secret communication; stationary strategies; stochastic games,Game theory; Intrusion detection; Security systems; Stochastic systems; eavesdropping; Game theoretic analysis; Intruder detection systems; Reliable communication; Secret communications; Simple stochastic games; stationary strategies; Stochastic game; Jamming,,,,,"Koyluoglu, O.O., El Gamal, H., Lai, L., Poor, H.V., Interference alignment for secrecy (2011) IEEE Trans.

The attacks may comprise multiple actions that arehard to differentiate from benign activity, and therefore commondetection techniques have to deal with high false positive rates. Because of the imperfect performance of automated detectiontechniques, responses to such attacks are highly dependent onhuman-driven decision-making processes. While game theory hasbeen applied to many problems that require rational decisionmaking, we find limitation on applying such method on securitygames when the defender has limited information about theopponent's strategies and payoffs. In this work, we propose Q-Learning to react automatically to the adversarial behavior ofa suspicious user to secure the system. This work comparesvariations of Q-Learning with a traditional stochastic game. Simulation results show the possibility of Naive Q-Learning, despite restricted information on opponents. © 2016 IEEE.",,Behavioral research; Decision making; Stochastic systems; Systems engineering; Cyber security; Decision making process; False positive rates; Limited information; Q-learning; Stochastic game; Game theory,,,,,"Templeton, S.J., Levitt, K., A requires/provides model for computer attacks (2001) Proceedings of the 2000 Workshop on New Security Paradigms, pp. 31-38. , ACM; Sharma, A., Kalbarczyk, Z., Barlow, J., Iyer, R., Analysis of security data from a large computing organization (2011) Dependable Systems & Networks (DSN), 2011 IEEE/IFIP 41st International Conference on, pp. 506-517. , IEEE; Watkins, C.J., Dayan, P., Q-learning (1992) Machine Learning, 8 (3-4), pp. 279-292; Shapley, L.S., Stochastic games (1953) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 39 (10), p. 1095; Lye, K.-W., Wing, J.M., Game strategies in network security (2002) Foundations of Computer Security, p. 13; Zonouz, S.A., Khurana, H., Sanders, W.H., Yardley, T.M., Rre: A game-theoretic intrusion response and recovery engine (2009) Dependable Systems & Networks, 2009.

In each round of this repeated game, a player selects an action from a decision set using a randomized strategy, and then Nature reveals a loss function for this action, for which the player incurs a loss. The game then repeats for a total of T rounds, over which the player seeks to minimize the total incurred loss, or more specifically, the excess incurred loss with respect to a fixed comparison class. The added challenge over traditional online optimization, is that for k of the T rounds, after the player selects an action, an adversarial agent perturbs this action arbitrarily. Through a worst case adversary framework to model the perturbations, we introduce a randomized algorithm that is provably robust against such adversarial attacks. In particular, we show that this algorithm is Hannan consistent with respect to a rich class of randomized strategies under mild regularity conditions. © 2015 IEEE.",Adversarial perturbations; online optimization; randomized algorithms; repeated games; robustness,Electrical engineering; Robustness (control systems); Signal processing; Adversarial agent; Adversarial perturbations; Loss functions; Online optimization; Randomized Algorithms; Randomized strategy; Regularity condition; Repeated games; Optimization,,,,,"Zinkevich, M., Online convex programming and generalized infinitesimal gradient ascent (2003) Proc. 20th Int.

While previous work has been mainly focused on devising adversary-aware classification algorithms to counter evasion attempts, only few authors have considered the impact of using reduced feature sets on classifier security against the same attacks. An interesting, preliminary result is that classifier security to evasion may be even worsened by the application of feature selection. In this paper, we provide a more detailed investigation of this aspect, shedding some light on the security properties of feature selection against evasion attacks. Inspired by previous work on adversary-aware classifiers, we propose a novel adversary-aware feature selection model that can improve classifier security against evasion attacks, by incorporating specific assumptions on the adversary's data manipulation strategy. We focus on an efficient, wrapper-based implementation of our approach, and experimentally validate its soundness on different application examples, including spam and malware detection. © 2015 IEEE.",Adversarial learning; classifier security; evasion attacks; feature selection; malware detection; spam filtering,Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Computer crime; Internet; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Malware; Mobile security; Pattern recognition; Application examples; Classification algorithm; Data manipulations; Feature sets; Machine learning techniques; Malware detection; Security properties; Test time; Feature extraction,,,,,"Biggio, B., Akhtar, Z., Fumera, G., Marcialis, G.L., Roli, F., Security evaluation of biometric authentication systems under real spoofing attacks (2012) IET Biometrics, 1 (1), pp. 11-24; Rodrigues, R.N., Ling, L.L., Govindaraju, V., Robustness of multimodal biometric fusion methods against spoof attacks (2009) J.

An attacker compromises the input stream and modifies the control signals transmitted with the objective of increasing the quadratic cost incurred by the controller. The optimal adversarial control signals are characterized for a finite horizon LQG problem under a stealthiness/detectability constraint. The tradeoff between the increase in quadratic cost, and the detectability of data injection, as measured by the K-L divergence between legitimate and falsified data dynamics, is derived analytically. The optimal adversarial control signals are shown to be Gaussian with the sequence of variances derived as a function of system parameters and the desired cost increase. © 2015 IEEE.",,Information science; Control signal; Cost-increases; Data dynamics; Detectability; False data injection; Finite horizons; Input streams; Quadratic costs; Costs,,,,,"Mo, Y., Sinopoli, B., False data injection attacks in control systems (2010) Preprints of the 1st Workshop on Secure Control Systems, pp. 1-6; Kosut, O., Jia, L., Thomas, R.J., Tong, L., Malicious data attacks on the smart grid (2011) Smart Grid, IEEE Transactions on, 2 (4), pp. 645-658; Liu, Y., Ning, P., Reiter, M.K., False data injection attacks against state estimation in electric power grids (2011) ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC), 14 (1), p. 13; Xie, L., Mo, Y., Sinopoli, B., Integrity data attacks in power market operations (2011) Smart Grid, IEEE Transactions on, 2 (4), pp. 659-666; Lin, J., Yu, W., Yang, X., Xu, G., Zhao, W., On false data injection attacks against distributed energy routing in smart grid (2012) Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS), 2012 IEEE/ACM Third International Conference On.

A major issue with existing online solutions is reliance on authorities, which in practice are often instantiated by only one organisation. We propose a conceptually simple but highly robust approach for casting ballots over commodity anonymisers under minimal assumptions. While other schemes have followed a similar approach none have utilised the primitives to achieve so many desirable properties. We then exploit this to construct a practical instantiation, called VOTOR-Voting over Tor-(one need not use Tor specifically), whose properties we show to compare favourably with prominent modern remote voting schemes such as Remotegrity and Helios. In particular, it shares the same coercion-resistance property, which we call weak receiptfreeness, as the latter two, but also provides privacy against election tellers. It is also conceptually simpler in its design than most modern schemes, and can be instantiated to allow voting credentials to persist from one election to the next without privacy attacks on past elections.

Often a pair of agents in the network interacts in order for an informed sender-agent to signal an uninformed receiver-agent to take an action that benefits each of the players; the benefits to the pair of agents are modeled by two separate utility functions, both depending on the sender’s private information, the signal exchanged, and the receiver’s revealed (and also possibly unrevealed) action. In general, the two agents’ utilities may not be aligned and may encourage deceptive behavior. For example, a sender, aware of his/her own private “state of ignorance”, may seek useful information from a receiver who owns powerful computational resources to search a large corpus of webpages; the sender does so by sending a signal to the receiver in the form of a keyword. Obvious examples of deceptiveness here range from attempts to hide one’s intentions to auctioning the keywords on an ad exchange through real-time bidding. A rather troublesome situation occurs when deceptions are employed to breach the security of the system, thus making the entire social-technological network unreliable. Earlier, we proposed a signaling-game-theoretic framework to alleviate this problem. This paper further enhances that framework by reconfiguring signals to possess more complex structures (epistatic signals to represent attack and defense options over a given set of vulnerabilities). We explore two augmentations to the original evolutionary signaling game by first enhancing mutation bias toward strategies performing well in previous populations and second allowing the parameters of the utility functions to depend on population preferences giving rise to a minority game with epistatic signaling. The resulting game systems are empirically studied through extensive computer simulation. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Deception; Science of cyber security; Signaling games,Game theory; Signal receivers; Signaling; Computational resources; Cyber security; Deception; Private information; Signaling game; Strategic interactions; Technological networks; Technological system; Computer games,,,,,"Arthur, W.B., Inductive reasoning and bounded rationality (1994) Am Econ Rev, pp. 406-411; van den Berg, H.A., Design principles of adaptive cellular immunity for artificial immune systems (2009) Soft Comput, 13 (11), pp. 1073-1080. , http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/soco/soco13.html#Berg09; Binmore, K.G., Samuelson, L., Evolutionary stability in repeated games played by finite automata (1992) J Econ Theory, pp. 278-305; Casey, W., Wright, E., Morales, J.A., Appel, M., Gennari, J., Mishra, B., Agent-based trace learnng in a recommendation-verification system for cybersecurity.

The use of jamming devices is a viable method for disabling the communication capabilities of enemy networks. This paper proposes a jamming technique which targets the periodic nature of the routing protocol residing in the network layer. The technique is based on the concept of null-frequency jamming which refers to periodic attacks targeting specific protocol period/frequency of operation. The effects of this jamming technique are investigated in stack, half-diamond, full-diamond, full-mesh and random topologies employing the optimised link state routing protocol. OMNeT++ 4.3 was chosen as the network simulation platform in which to conduct the investigations. It was found that when jamming at the 2 s null-period for a length of 0.5 s, there was a substantial drop in overall network performance. This technique was then compared to constant, deceptive and random jamming techniques and was shown to outperform the techniques in terms of the energy expended by the wireless nodes in the networks. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Great success has been achieved by applying machine learning and data mining to the security settings for large dataset, such as in intrusion detection, virus detection, biometric identity recognition, and spam filtering. However, the strengths of the learning systems, such as the adaptability and ability to infer patterns, can also become their vulnerabilities when there are adversarial manipulations during the learning and predicting process. Considering the fact that the traditional learning strategies could potentially introduce security faults into the learning systems, robust machine learning techniques against the sophisticated adversaries need to be studied, which is referred to as secure learning and mining through this abstract. Based on the goal of secure learning and mining, I aim to analyze the behavior of learning systems in adversarial environments by studying different kinds of attacks against the learning systems. Then design robust learning algorithms to counter the corresponding malicious behaviors based on the evaluation and prediction of the adversaries' goal and capabilities. The interactions between the defender and attackers are modeled as different forms of games, therefore game theoretic analysis are applied to evaluate and predict the constraints for both participants to deal with the real world large dataset. © 2015 IEEE.",adversarial learning; data mining; Game theory,Artificial intelligence; Computation theory; Computer viruses; Data mining; Decision making; Forecasting; Game theory; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Ubiquitous computing; Viruses; Adversarial environments; Adversarial learning; Computing applications; Evaluation and predictions; Game theoretic analysis; Machine learning techniques; Robust learning algorithm; Traditional learning; Learning algorithms,,,,,"Li, B., Vorobeychik, Y., Feature cross-substitution in adversarial classification (2014) Neural Information Processing Systems, , to appear; Dalvi, N., Domingos, P., Sanghai, S., Verma, D., Adversarial classification (2004) Proceedings of the Tenth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining.

Despite rich research has focused on browser-based web applications, little has been conducted on the implementation of SSO on mobile platforms. However, we reveal that due to the fundamental difference of isolation mechanism in mobile OS and applications from the origin-based isolation in browsers, the SSO encounters a novel attack surface and adversarial models. We perform the first formal analysis on the implementation of the most widely used SSO service - Facebook Login. Our study takes as input the available implementation and dynamic execution traces of Facebook SDK for Android, from which we abstract the implementation-level protocol. The protocol is then modeled in typed Pi-calculus, and automatically checked against the mobile platform specific attack models in a protocol verifier Proverif.

However, while these routing protocols have been proposed from different research groups in the literature, which shows the existing routing protocols, are not consistent to common framework to evaluate its performance. Moreover, these protocols are vulnerable to many collaborative attacks, due to its cooperative nature of routing algorithms. Hence, it is difficult for one to choose a proper routing protocol for a given application; therefore, we initially study and review to compare the different existing routing protocols in adversarial environment with varying traffic and mobility simulation scenarios. This paper addresses the comparison of various reactive routing protocols in adversarial environment. To achieve this, we had investigated with widely used NS-2 simulators for fair comparisons of different routing protocols. Furthermore, we also develop a collaborative adversary model for these existing routing protocols that can interfere with communications to subvert the normal operation of the network. Specifically, Our extensive simulation results shows the relative quantitative analysis for comparing the performance of reactive routing protocols such as AODV, DSR under adversarial environments with varying traffic and mobility simulation scenarios. Moreover, the performance of these protocols is measured with the various metrics such as throughput, end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio, and routing overhead.

The photograph had a historic role helping to ‘mark out’ the Vietnam War as a source of national shame (MacDonald, Hughes and Dodds 2010b: 11) and a journalist has called it ‘one of the key images of the Vietnam War, creating such shock and revulsion that it was widely credited with hastening the American withdrawal from South-east Asia’ (Preston 2007; see also Chong 2000). President Nixon suspected that the picture had been ‘fixed’ (Collins 2002), indicating the potent yet contestable truth-claim of the photographic medium as well as the adversarial relationship that emerged during this war between journalists and policy-makers as ‘the tensions held within the conjunction of democratic and imperial impulses in the American worldview began to visually erupt’ (Kennedy 2008: 282). © Klaus Dodds, Merje Kuus and Joanne Sharp 2013.

From the Google self-driving car, to autonomous delivery robots, to hobbyist UAVs, there is a staggering variety of proposed deployments for autonomous vehicles. Ensuring that such vehicles can plan and execute routes safely is crucial. The key insight of our paper is that the sensors that autonomous vehicles use to navigate represent a vector for adversarial control. With direct knowledge of how sensor algorithms operate, the adversary can manipulate the victim’s environment to form an implicit control channel on the victim. We craft an attack based on this idea, which we call a sensor input spoofing attack. We demonstrate a sensor input spoofing attack against the popular Lucas-Kanade method for optical flow sensing and characterize the ability of an attacker to trick optical flow via simulation. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our optical flow sensor input spoofing attack against two consumer-grade UAVs, the AR.Drone 2.0 and the APM 2.5 ArduCopter. Finally, we introduce a method for defending against such an attack on optical-flow sensors, both using the RANSAC algorithm and a more robust weighted RANSAC algorithm to synthesize sensor outputs. © 2016 USENIX Association.

Unfortunately, existing approaches for evaluating password strength by modeling adversarial password guessing are either inaccurate or orders of magnitude too large and too slow for real-time, client-side password checking. We propose using artificial neural networks to model text passwords’ resistance to guessing attacks and explore how different architectures and training methods impact neural networks’ guessing effectiveness. We show that neural networks can often guess passwords more effectively than state-of-the-art approaches, such as probabilistic context-free grammars and Markov models. We also show that our neural networks can be highly compressed—to as little as hundreds of kilobytes—without substantially worsening guessing effectiveness. Building on these results, we implement in JavaScript the first principled client-side model of password guessing, which analyzes a password’s resistance to a guessing attack of arbitrary duration with sub-second latency. Together, our contributions enable more accurate and practical password checking than was previously possible. © 2016 Proceedings of the 25th USENIX Security Symposium.

First, a set of necessary conditions for optimal control is given in the case of the dynamic (multi-stage) weight selection problem of consensus protocols. Under some mild conditions, it turns out that only one-stage is sufficient for reaching consensus, and the article derives a closed-form solution for the optimal control. Second, a (zero-sum) game theoretical model with a “convex-convex” quadratic objective function is considered for the problem of a network with an adversary corrupting the control signal with noise. Mixed-strategy saddle-point (MSSP) strategies are obtained for the players (the adversary and the network designer) in the resulting game.

As these systems are becoming increasingly popular in the industry, their outputs could affect business decision making, introducing incentives for an adversarial party to compromise the availability or integrity of such systems. We introduce a data poisoning attack on collaborative filtering systems. We demonstrate how a powerful attacker with full knowledge of the learner can generate malicious data so as to maximize his/her malicious objectives, while at the same time mimicking normal user behavior to avoid being detected. While the complete knowledge assumption seems extreme, it enables a robust assessment of the vulnerability of collaborative filtering schemes to highly motivated attacks. We present efficient solutions for two popular factorization-based collaborative filtering algorithms: the alternative minimization formulation and the nuclear norm minimization method. Finally, we test the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms on real-world data and discuss potential defensive strategies. © 2016 NIPS Foundation - All Rights Reserved.",,Behavioral research; Decision making; Factorization; Filtration; Information filtering; Alternative minimizations; Business decisions; Collaborative filtering algorithms; Collaborative filtering systems; Defensive strategies; E-Commerce applications; Nuclear norm minimizations; Poisoning attacks; Collaborative filtering,,,,,"Wang, J., De Vires, A., Reinders, M., Unifying user-based and item-based collaborative filtering approaches by similarity fusion (2006) SIGIR; Candès, E., Recht, B., Exact matrix completion via convex optimization (2007) Foundations of Computational Mathematics, 9 (6), pp. 717-772; Cai, J.-F., Candès, E., Shen, Z., A singular value thresholding algorithm for matrix completion (2010) SIAM Journal on Optimization, 20 (4), pp. 1956-1982; Mobasher, B., Burke, R., Bhaumik, R., Williams, C., Effective attack models for shilling item-based collaborative filtering systems (2005) Proceedings of the 2005 WebKDD Workshop, Held in Conjuction with ACM SIGKDD'2005; O'Mahony, M.P., Hurley, N.J., Silvestre, G.C.M., Promoting recommendations: An attack on collaborative filtering (2002) Database and Expert Systems Applications, pp. 494-503. , Springer; Jain, P., Netrapalli, P., Sanghavi, S., Low-rank matrix completion using alternating minimization (2013) STOC; Xiao, H., Biggio, B., Brown, G., Fumera, G., Eckert, C., Roli, F., Is feature selection secure against training data poisoning (2015) ICML; Mei, S., Zhu, X., The security of latent dirichlet allocation (2015) AISTATS; Mei, S., Zhu, X., Using machine teaching to identify optimal training-set attacks on machine learners (2015) AAAI; Welling, M., Teh, Y.W., Bayesian learning via stochastic gradient langevin dynamics (2011) Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML-11), pp. 681-688; Dalvi, N., Domingos, P., Sanghai, S., Verma, D., Adversarial classification (2004) Proceedings of the Tenth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 99-108. , ACM; Lowd, D., Meek, C., Adversarial learning (2005) Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery in Data Mining, pp. 641-647. , ACM; Li, B., Vorobeychik, Y., Feature cross-substitution in adversarial classification (2014) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 2087-2095; Li, B., Vorobeychik, Y., Scalable optimization of randomized operational decisions in adversarial classification settings (2015) Proceedings of the Eighteenth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, pp. 599-607; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Joseph, A.D., Doug Tygar, J., Can machine learning be secure?

Cyber defenders have very little visibility into security/cost tradeoffs between individual defenses and a poor understanding of how multiple defenses interact, which, in turn, leads to systems that are insecure or too overloaded with security processing to provide necessary mission functionality. We have been developing a reasoning framework, called Attack Surface Reasoning (ASR), which enables cyber defenders to explore quantitative tradeoffs between security and cost of various compositions of cyber defense models. ASR automatically quantifies and compares cost and security metrics across multiple attack surfaces, covering both mission and system dimensions. In addition, ASR automatically identifies opportunities for minimizing attack surfaces, e.g., by removing interactions that are not required for successful mission execution. In this paper, we present the ontologies used for attack surface reasoning. In particular, this includes threat models describing important aspects of the target networked systems together with abstract definitions of adversarial activities. We also describe modeling of cyber defenses with a particular focus on Moving Target Defenses (MTDs), missions, and metrics. We demonstrate the usefulness and applicability of the ontologies by presenting instance models from a fictitious deployment, and show how the models support the overall functionality of attack surface reasoning. © 2016, CEUR-WS.

College of Engineering, Andhra University, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, India","Privacy preserving data publication is a major concern for both the owners of data and the data publishers. Principles like K-anonymity, l-diversity were proposed to reduce privacy violations. On the other side, no studies were found on verification on the anonymized data in terms of adversarial breach and anonymity levels. However, the anonymized data is still prone to attacks due to the presence of dependencies among quasi-identifiers and sensitive attributes. This paper presents a novel framework to detect the existence of those dependencies and a solution to reduce them. The advantages of our approach are i) privacy violations can be detected, ii) the extent of privacy risk can be measured and iii) re-anonymization can be done on vulnerable blocks of data. The work is further extended to show how the adversarial breach knowledge eventually increased when new tuples are added and an on the fly solution to reduce it is discussed.

OPSEC is especially a paramount consideration in the light of recent calls in the U.S. for spectrum sharing between federal government (including military) systems and non- government systems (e.g., cellular service providers). In this paper, we explore the OPSEC, location privacy in particular, of incumbent radars in the 3.5 GHz band. First, we show that adversarial secondary users can easily infer the locations of incumbent radars by making seemingly innocuous queries to the database. Then, we propose several obfuscation techniques that can be implemented by the database for countering the inference attacks. We also investigate the inherent tradeoff between the degree of obfuscation and spectrum utilization efficiency. Finally, we validate our discussions by providing results from extensive simulations. © 2016 IEEE.",,Database systems; Query languages; Radar; Cellular services; Extensive simulations; Federal governments; Geo-location database; Government systems; Inference attacks; Operational security; Spectrum utilization efficiency; Location,,,,,"(2012) Report to the President Realizing the Full Potential of Government-held Spectrum to Spur Economic Growth, , http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcastspectrumreportfinaljuly202012.pdf, PCAST, July; Report and Order and Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Federal Communications Commission, , https://apps.fcc.gov/edocspublic/attachmatch/FCC-15-71A1.pdf, FCC, accessed 04-14-2016; Bahrak, B., Bhattarai, S., Ullah, A., Park, J.M.J., Reed, J., Gurney, D., Protecting the primary users' operational privacy in spectrum sharing (2014) Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DYSPAN), 2014 IEEE International Symposium on, pp. 236-247. , April; Park, J.M., Reed, J.H., Beex, A.A., Clancy, T.C., Kumar, V., Bahrak, B., Security and enforcement in spectrum sharing (2014) Proceedings of the IEEE, 102, pp. 270-281. , March; Zhang, Z., Zhang, H., He, S., Cheng, P., Achieving bilateral utility maximization and location privacy preservation in database-driven cognitive radio networks (2015) Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems (MASS), 2015 IEEE 12th International Conference on, pp. 181-189. , Oct; Clark, M., Psounis, K., Can the privacy of primary networks in shared spectrum be protected (2016) 2016 IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM), , Apr; Spectrum Sharing Committee Website, , http://www.wirelessinnovation.org/ssc, WINNF; Shared Spectrum Access for Radar and Communications (Ssparc) Website, , http://www.darpa.mil/program/shared-spectrum-access-for-radar-and-communications, DARPA; Bhattarai, S., Park, J.M.J., Gao, B., Bian, K., Lehr, W., An overview of dynamic spectrum sharing: Ongoing initiatives, challenges, and a roadmap for future research (2016) IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking, 2, pp. 110-128. , June; Wiki, S., Spn-43 Shipborne Radar, Spectrum Wiki, , http://www.spectrumwiki.com/wiki/DisplayEntry.aspxDisplyId=225; DARPA Awards Leidos Prime Contract, Leidos Website, , http://investors.leidos.com/mobile.viewc=193857&v=203&d=1&id=2106132, Leidos, accessed 04-14-2016; Shokri, R., Theodorakopoulos, G., Boudec, J.Y.L., Hubaux, J.P., Quantifying location privacy (2011) 2011 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 247-262. , May; Hamid, M., Björsell, N., Geo-location spectrum opportunities database in downlink radar bands for OFDM based cognitive radios (2011) IEEE Conference on Communication, Science & Information Engineering CCSIE 2011 IEEE, pp. 39-43; Bhattarai, S., Ullah, A., Park, J.M.J., Reed, J.H., Gurney, D., Gao, B., Defining incumbent protection zones on the fly: Dynamic boundaries for spectrum sharing (2015) Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN), 2015 IEEE International Symposium on, pp. 251-262. , Sept",,,AT and T;et al.;Huawei;Intel;National Instruments;Qualcomm,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"59th IEEE Global Communications Conference, GLOBECOM 2016",4 December 2016 through 8 December 2016,,126373,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Glob.

However, with a large-scale social network, their privacy rights have been significantly intruded by adversarial users that perform social attacks including false / illegal private information dissemination or the use of fake identities. In this work, we study how individual users can expand their social networks by making trustworthy friends while not leaking their private information out to unauthorized parties or social attackers. We adopt the concepts of trust and reputation in order to preserve users' privacy while enhancing their social capital in OSNs. Given a social network topology from the Facebook, we model an individual user's interactions with other users based on feeding (e.g., posting information) and feedback behaviors (e.g., providing likes or comments). Our results show that there exists a tradeoff between social capital and privacy preservation. In addition, we show there exists a balance point of social capital and privacy thresholds that maximizes correct information diffusion while minimizing illegal private information leakout, given users' risk appetite for preserving privacy. © 2016 IEEE.",,Information dissemination; Online systems; Topology; Information diffusion; Network topology; On-line social networks; Online social networks (OSNs); Privacy preservation; Private information; Social relationships; Trust and reputation; Social networking (online),,,,,"Hart, J., Ridley, C., Taher, F., Sas, C., Dix, A., Exploring the facebook experience: A new approach to usability (2008) 5th Nordic Conference on Human-Computer Interaction: Building Bridges, , Lund, Sweden; Zhang, Y., Tang, L., Leung, L., Gratifications, collective self-esteem, online emotional openness, and traitlike communication apprehension as predictors of facebook uses (2011) Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, 14 (12), pp. 733-739; Brandtzaeg, P.B., Luders, M., Skjetne, J.H., Too many facebook friends"".

Maintaining security of UAVs under cyber attacks is an important yet challenging task, as these attacks are often erratic and difficult to predict. Secure estimation problems study how to estimate the states of a dynamical system from a set of noisy and maliciously corrupted sensor measurements. The fewer assumptions that an estimator makes about the attacker, the larger the set of attacks it can protect the system against. In this paper, we focus on sensor attacks on UAVs and attempt to design a secure estimator for linear time-invariant systems based on as few assumptions about the attackers as possible. We propose a computationally efficient estimator that protects the system against arbitrary and unbounded attacks, where the set of attacked sensors can also change over time.

In addition, different international laws and cross-continental cybercrimes become immune from being affected by a global public policy on how data traffic should be treated.

Remarkably, crippling subliminal attacks are possible even if the subverted cryptosystem produces output indistinguishable from a truly secure “reference implementation.” Bellare, Paterson, and Rogaway [Crypto ’14] recently initiated a formal study of such attacks on symmetric key encryption algorithms, demonstrating that kleptographic attacks can be mounted in broad generality against randomized components of cryptographic systems. We enlarge the scope of current work on the problem by permitting adversarial subversion of (randomized) key generation; in particular, we initiate the study of cryptography in the complete subversion model, where all relevant cryptographic primitives are subject to kleptographic attacks.We construct secure one-way permutations and trapdoor one-way permutations in this “complete subversion” model, describing a general, rigorous immunization strategy to clip the power of kleptographic subversions. Our strategy can be viewed as a formal treatment of the folklore “nothing up my sleeve” wisdom in cryptographic practice. We also describe a related “split program” model that can directly inform practical deployment. We additionally apply our general immunization strategy to directly yield a backdoor-free PRG. This notably amplifies previous results of Dodis, Ganesh, Golovnev, Juels, and Ristenpart [Eurocrypt ’15], which require an honestly generated random key. We then examine two standard applications of (trapdoor) one-way permutations in this complete subversion model and construct “higher level” primitives via black-box reductions. We showcase a digital signature scheme that preserves existential unforgeability when all algorithms (including key generation, which was not considered to be under attack before) are subject to kleptographic attacks. Additionally, we demonstrate that the classic Blum–Micali pseudorandom generator (PRG), using an “immunized” one-way permutation, yields a backdoor-free PRG. Alongside development of these secure primitives, we set down a hierarchy of kleptographic attack models which we use to organize past results and our new contributions; this taxonomy may be valuable for future work. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2016.",,Authentication; Electronic document identification systems; Immunization; Security of data; Black-box reductions; Cryptographic primitives; Cryptographic systems; Digital signature schemes; Pseudorandom generators; Reference implementation; Symmetric key encryption algorithm; Trapdoor one-way permutation; Cryptography,,,,,"Ateniese, G., Magri, B., Venturi, D., Subversion-resilient signature schemes (2015) ACM CCS 15, pp. 364-375. , Ray, I., Li, N., Kruegel, C.

We consider a new network formation game that incorporates an adversarial attack, as well as immunization or protection against the attack. An agent’s network benefit is the expected size of her connected component post-attack, and agents may also choose to immunize themselves from attack at some additional cost. Our framework can be viewed as a stylized model of settings where reachability rather than centrality is the primary interest (as in many technological networks such as the Internet), and vertices may be vulnerable to attacks (such as viruses), but may also reduce risk via potentially costly measures (such as an anti-virus software). Our main theoretical contributions include a strong bound on the edge density at equilibrium. In particular, we show that under a very mild assumption on the adversary’s attack model, every equilibrium network contains at most only 2n−4 edges for n ≥ 4, where n denotes the number of agents and this upper bound is tight. We also show that social welfare does not significantly erode: every non-trivial equilibrium with respect to several adversarial attack models asymptotically has social welfare at least as that of any equilibrium in the original attack-free model. We complement our sharp theoretical results by a behavioral experiment on our game with over 100 participants, where despite the complexity of the game, the resulting network was surprisingly close to equilibrium. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2016.",,Complex networks; Immunization; Risk assessment; Additional costs; Antivirus softwares; Behavioral experiment; Connected component; Network formation games; Non-trivial equilibrium; Strategic network formations; Technological networks; Computer viruses,,,,,"Alpcan, T., Baar, T., (2010) Network Security: A Decision and Game-Theoretic Approach, 1St Edn, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Anderson, R., (2008) Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems, , 2nd edn.

Game theoretic models of security, and Stackelberg security games in particular, have received special attention, in part because these models and associated tools have seen actual deployment in homeland security and sustainability applications. Stackelberg security games have two prototypical features: 1) a collection of potential assets which require protection, and 2) a sequential structure, where a defender first allocates protection resources, and the attacker then responds with an optimal attack. I see the latter feature as the major conceptual breakthrough, allowing very broad application of the idea beyond physical security settings. In particular, I describe three research problems which on the surface look nothing like prototypical security games: adversarial machine learning, privacy-preserving data sharing, and vaccine design. I describe how the second conceptual aspect of security games offers a natural modeling paradigm for these. This, in turn, has two important benefits: first, it offers a new perspective on these problems, and second, facilitates fundamental algorithmic contributions for these domains.",,Artificial intelligence; Game theory; Learning systems; Broad application; Game-theoretic model; Models and algorithms; Physical security; Privacy preserving; Research problems; Security problems; Sequential structure; Data privacy,,,,,"Fredrikson, M., Lantz, E., Jha, S., Lin, S., Page, D., Ristenpart, T., Privacy in pharmacogenetics: An end-to-end case study of personalized warfarin dosing (2014) USENIX Security Symposium, pp. 17-32; Li, B., Vorobeychik, Y., Feature cross-substitution in adversarial classification (2014) Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 2087-2095; Li, B., Vorobeychik, Y., Scalable optimization of randomized operational decisions in adversarial classification settings (2015) Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics; Li, Y., O'Dell, S., Walker, L.M., Wu, X., Guenaga, J., Feng, Y., Schmidt, S.D., Mascola, J.R., Mechanism of neutralization by the broadly neutralizing HIV-1 monoclonal antibody VRC01 (2011) Journal of Virology, 85 (17), pp. 8954-8967; Lowd, D., Meek, C., Adversarial learning (2005) International Conference on Knowledge Discovery in Data Mining, pp. 641-647. , ACM; Panda, S., Vorobeychik, Y., Stackelberg games for vaccine design (2015) International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, pp. 1391-1399; Paruchuri, P., Pearce, J.P., Marecki, J., Tambe, M., Ordóñez, F., Kraus, S., Playing games with security: An efficient exact algorithm for Bayesian Stackelberg games (2008) International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, pp. 895-902; Sweeney, L., Weaving technology and policy together to maintain confidentiality (1997) J Law Med Ethics, 25 (2-3), pp. 98-110; Sweeney, L., Achieving k-anonymity privacy protection using generalization and suppression (2002) Int J Uncertainty Fuzz, 10 (5), pp. 571-588; Wan, Z., Vorobeychik, Y., Xia, W., Wright Clayton, E., Kantarcioglu, M., Ganta, R., Heatherly, R., Malin, B.A., A game theoretic framework for analyzing re-identification risk (2015) PLoS ONE, 10 (3), p. e0120592","Vorobeychik, Y.; Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, United States; 电子邮件: yevgeniy.vorobeychik@vanderbilt.edu",Kambhampati S.,AI Journal;Arizona State University;Baidu;et al.;IBM Watson;Sony,International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence,"25th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IJCAI 2016",9 July 2016 through 15 July 2016,,125002,10450823,,,,English,IJCAI Int.

For example, the inspection could target important mislabeled samples or key vulnerabilities exploitable by an adversarial attack. In order to solve the 'needle in the haystack' problem of which samples to inspect, we develop a new scalable version of Cook's distance, a classical statistical technique for identifying samples which unusually strongly impact the fit of a regression model (and its downstream predictions). In order to scale this technique up to very large and high-dimensional datasets, we introduce a new algorithm which we call 'influence sketching.' Influence sketching embeds random projections within the influence computation; in particular, the influence score is calculated using the randomly projected pseudo-dataset from the post-convergence General Linear Model (GLM). We validate that influence sketching can reliably and successfully discover influential samples by applying the technique to a malware detection dataset of over 2 million executable files, each represented with almost 100,000 features. For example, we find that randomly deleting approximately 10% of training samples reduces predictive accuracy only slightly from 99.47% to 99.45%, whereas deleting the same number of samples with high influence sketch scores reduces predictive accuracy all the way down to 90.24%. Moreover, we find that influential samples are especially likely to be mislabeled. In the case study, we manually inspect the most influential samples, and find that influence sketching pointed us to new, previously unidentified pieces of malware. © 2016 IEEE.",,Computer crime; Inspection; Malware; Regression analysis; General linear modeling; High dimensional datasets; Large-scale data analysis; Malware detection; Manual inspection; Predictive accuracy; Random projections; Statistical techniques; Big data,,,,,,,Ak R.Karypis G.Xia Y.Hu X.T.Yu P.S.Joshi J.Ungar L.Liu L.Sato A.-H.Suzumura T.Rachuri S.Govindaraju R.Xu W.,Cisco;et al.;Huawei;IEEE;IEEE Computer Society;National Science Foundation (NSF),Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"4th IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2016",5 December 2016 through 8 December 2016,,126355,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

Typical security goals for whitebox cryptography include key extraction security and decomposition security: Indeed, it should be infeasible to recover the secret key from the implementation and it should be hard to decompose the implementation by finding a more compact representation without recovering the secret key, which mitigates code lifting. Whereas all published whitebox implementations for standard cryptographic algorithms such as DES or AES are prone to practical key extraction attacks, there have been two dedicated design approaches for whitebox block ciphers: ASASA by Birykov et al. at ASIACRYPT’14 and SPACE by Bogdanov and Isobe at CCS’15. While ASASA suffers from decomposition attacks, SPACE reduces the security against key extraction and decomposition attacks in the white box to the security of a standard block cipher such as AES in the standard blackbox setting. However, due to the security-prioritized design strategy, SPACE imposes a sometimes prohibitive performance overhead in the real world as it needs many AES calls to encrypt a single block. In this paper, we address the issue by designing a family of dedicated whitebox block ciphers SPNbox and a family of underlying small block ciphers with software efficiency and constant-time execution in mind. While still relying on the standard blackbox block cipher security for the resistance against key extraction and decomposition, SPNbox attains speed-ups of up to 6.5 times in the black box and up to 18 times in the white box on Intel Skylake and ARMv8 CPUs, compared to SPACE. The designs allow for constant-time implementations in the blackbox setting and meet the practical requirements to whitebox cryptography in real-world applications such as DRM or mobile payments. Moreover, we formalize resistance towards decomposition in form of weak and strong space hardness at various security levels. We obtain bounds on space hardness in all those adversarial models. Thus, for the first time, SPNbox provides a practical whitebox block cipher that features well-understood key extraction security, rigorous analysis towards decomposition security, demonstrated real-world efficiency on various platforms and constant-time implementations. This paves the way to enhancing susceptible real-world applications with whitebox cryptography. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2016.",Code lifting; Decomposition; Key extraction; Malware; Mass surveillance; Space hardness; Trojans; White-box cryptography,Decomposition; Efficiency; Extraction; Hardness; Knowledge based systems; Lyapunov methods; Malware; Program processors; Security of data; Standards; Code lifting; Compact representation; Cryptographic algorithms; Decomposition attacks; Design strategies; Practical requirements; Trojans; White-box cryptographies; Cryptography,,,,,"(2014) Adobe Primetime Technical Primer for Operators; (2014) Securing Cloud-Based Workflows for Premium Content; Benadjila, R., Billet, O., Gilbert, H., Macario-Rat, G., Peyrin, T., Robshaw, M., Seurin, Y., SHA-3 Proposal: ECHO (2009) Submission to NIST; Barreto, P., Rijmen, V., The Anubis Block Cipher (2000) Submission to the NESSIE Project; Barreto, P., Rijmen, V., The Khazad Legacy-level Block Cipher (2000) Submission to the NESSIE Project; Billet, O., Gilbert, H., Ech-Chatbi, C., Cryptanalysis of a white box AES implementation (2004) SAC 2004.

The main goal is to achieve full 2n security. Such a tweakable blockcipher was proposed by Mennink at FSE’15, and it is also the only tweakable blockcipher so far that claimed full 2n security to our best knowledge. However, we find a key-recovery attack on Mennink’s proposal (in the proceeding version) with a complexity of about 2n/2 adversarial queries. The attack well demonstrates that Mennink’s proposal has at most 2n/2 security, and therefore invalidates its security claim. In this paper, we study a construction of tweakable blockciphers denoted as E[s] that is built on s invocations of a blockcipher and additional simple XOR operations. As proven in previous work, at least two invocations of blockcipher with linear mixing are necessary to possibly bypass the birthday-bound barrier of 2n/2 security, we carry out an investigation on the instances of E[s] with s ≥ 2, and find 32 highly efficient tweakable blockciphers E1, E2, …, E32 that achieve 2n provable security. Each of these tweakable blockciphers uses two invocations of a blockcipher, one of which uses a tweak-dependent key generated by XORing the tweak to the key (or to a secret subkey derived from the key).

This paper presents an approach to authentication and transaction verification using a trusted mobile device, equipped with a camera, in conjunction with QR codes. The mobile device does not require an active connection (e.g., Internet or cellular network), as the required information is obtained by the mobile device through its camera, i.e. solely via the visual channel. The proposed approach consists of an initial user authentication phase, which is followed by a transaction verification phase. The transaction verification phase provides a mechanism whereby important transactions have to be verified by both the user and the server. We describe the adversarial model to capture the possible attacks to the system. In addition, this paper analyzes the security of the propose scheme, and discusses the practical issues and mechanisms by which the scheme is able to circumvent a variety of security threats including password stealing, man-in-the-middle and man-in-the-browser attacks. We note that our technique is applicable to many practical applications ranging from standard user authentication implementations to protecting online banking transactions. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",Authentication; Mobile device; One-Time-Password (OTP); QR code; Transaction integrity; Transaction verification; Transaction-Authentication-Number (TAN),Cameras; Codes (symbols); Mobile devices; Mobile security; Network security; Man in the middle; One time passwords; Online transaction; QR codes; Security threats; Transaction authentications; Transaction integrity; User authentication; Authentication,,,,,"Barkan, E., Biham, E., Conditional estimators: An effective attack on A5/ 1 (2006) SAC 2005.

However, in such settings, they have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, including the deliberate manipulation of data at test time to evade detection. In this work, we focus on the vulnerability of linear classifiers to evasion attacks. This can be considered a relevant problem, as linear classifiers have been increasingly used in embedded systems and mobile devices for their low processing time and memory requirements. We exploit recent findings in robust optimization to investigate the link between regularization and security of linear classifiers, depending on the type of attack. We also analyze the relationship between the sparsity of feature weights, which is desirable for reducing processing cost, and the security of linear classifiers. We further propose a novel octagonal regularizer that allows us to achieve a proper trade-off between them. Finally, we empirically show how this regularizer can improve classifier security and sparsity in real-world application examples including spam and malware detection. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,Computer crime; Economic and social effects; Embedded systems; Learning systems; Malware; Optimization; Syntactics; Application examples; Linear classifiers; Machine learning techniques; Malware detection; Memory requirements; Processing costs; Processing time; Robust optimization; Pattern recognition,,,,,"Dalvi, N., Domingos, P., Mausamsanghai, S., Verma, D., Adversarial classification (2004) 10Th International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), Seattle, WA, USA, pp. 99-108; Lowd, D., Meek, C., Adversarial learning (2005) 11Th International Conference on Knowledge Discovery in Data Mining (KDD), Chicago, IL, USA, pp. 641-647; Lowd, D., Meek, C., Good word attacks on statistical spam filters (2005) 2Nd Conference on Email and Anti-Spam (CEAS), Mountain View, CA, USA; Kolcz, A., Teo, C.H., Feature weighting for improved classifier robustness (2009) 6Th Conference on Email and Anti-Spam (CEAS), Mountain View, CA, USA; Nelson, B., Barreno, M., Chi, F.J., Joseph, A.D., Rubinstein, B.I.P., Saini, U., Sutton, C., Xia, K., Exploiting machine learning to subvert your spam filter (2008) LEET 2008, Berkeley, CA, USA, pp. 1-9. , USENIX Association; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., Can machine learning be secure?

Historically, analogue control systems in the absence of interactive communications are immune to cyber-attacks; however, digital control systems with extensive interconnection of reprogrammable components are intensely vulnerable to cyber-attacks which shed light on the significance and urgency of the cyber security. The current cyber security approaches, which merely focus on information networks, have not given multifaceted considerations to instrumentation and control (I&C) systems. The cyber-attack on I&C systems may lead to more severe consequences, including the abnormal change of parameters, the malfunction of equipment, and even the accident condition. The existing cyber security approaches for information networks, such as firewalls, encryption, can enhance the cyber security of I&C systems, but are often insufficient in addressing challenges associate with the I&C systems which link cyber space and physical systems. The defense approach based on physical information should be developed to meet the emerging challenges. In this paper, we propose the cyber-physical security (CPS) approach based on the physical process data for the cyber defense. This approach does not intend to replace current cyber defense mechanisms. It could be served as the last barrier for security defense. The goal of the CPS defense approach is to detect attacks at the beginning of the occurrence of physical process anomalies cause by cyber-attacks. A practical implementation of the CPS approach is proposed and its influence on the existing infrastructure is discussed. The statistical analysis techniques are utilized on physical process data for attack detection. The method of dynamic principal component analysis (dynamic PCA) is employed to characterize the correlation of multiple variables in the normal operational condition. In the abnormal operational occurrence, the chi-square detector is able to distinguish adversarial cyber-attacks from ordinary random failures.

Legacy distributed computational architectures (such as Hadoop or Zookeeper) are designed to tolerate crashes of individual machines. Later, Byzantine fault-tolerant Paxos as well as self-stabilizing Paxos were introduced. Here we present for the first time the self-stabilizing Byzantine fault-tolerant version of a distributed replicated machine. It can cope with any adversarial takeover on less than one third of the participating replicas. It also ensures automatic recovery following any transient violation of the system state, in particular after periods in which more than one third of the participants are Byzantine. A prototype of self-stabilizing Byzantine-tolerant replicated Hadoop master node has been implemented. Experiments show that fully distributed recovery of cloud infrastructures against Byzantine faults can be made practical when relying on self-stabilization in local nodes. Thus automated cloud protection against a wide variety of faults and attacks is possible. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,Fault tolerance; Network security; Stabilization; Automatic recovery; Byzantine fault; Cloud infrastructures; Computational architecture; Distributed computations; Fault-tolerant; Fundamental concepts; Self stabilization; Fault tolerant computer systems,,,,,"Baron, J., El Defrawy, K., Lampkins, J., Ostrovsky, R., How to withstand mobile virus attacks, revisited (2014) PODC, pp. 293-302; Binun, A., Bloch, M., Dolev, S., Kahil, M., Menuhin, B., Yagel, R., Coupaye, T., Wailly, A., Self-stabilizing virtual machine hypervisor architecture for resilient cloud (2014) IEEE International Workshop on Dependable and Secure Services (DSS); Bonomi, S., Dolev, S., Potop-Butucaru, M., Raynal, M., Stabilizing server-based storage in Byzantine asynchronous message-passing systems (2015) PODC, pp. 471-479; Blanchard, P., Dolev, S., Beauquier, J., Deläet, S., Practically self-stabilizing paxos replicated state-machine (2014) NETYS 2014.

We demonstrate passive bandwidth measurement to perform traffic analysis attacks on co-located VMs. Our attacks do not assume a privileged position in the network or require any communication between adversarial and victim VMs. Using a single feature in the observed bandwidth data, our algorithm can identify which of 3 potential YouTube videos a co-resident VM streamed with 66% accuracy. We discuss defense from both a cloud provider’s and a consumer’s perspective, showing that effective defense is difficult to achieve without costly under-utilization on the part of the cloud provider or over-utilization on the part of the consumer. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",Cloud privacy; Encrypted communication analysis; Network virtualization; Side channel; Traffic analysis,Bandwidth; Cryptography; Distributed computer systems; Network security; Bandwidth measurements; Cloud environments; Encrypted communication; Network virtualization; Side-channel; Traffic analysis; Traffic analysis attacks; Virtual machines; Side channel attack,,,,,"Bates, A.M., Mood, B., Pletcher, J., Pruse, H., Valafar, M., Butler, K.R.B., Detecting co-residency with active traffic analysis techniques (2012) Proceedings of the 2012 ACM Workshop on Cloud Computing Security, pp. 1-12. , ACM; Chen, S., Wang, R., Wang, X., Zhang, K., Side-channel leaks in web applications: A reality today, a challenge tomorrow (2010) Proceedings of the 2010 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, SP 2010, pp. 191-206. , IEEE Computer Society, Washington; Dyer, K.P., Coull, S.E., Ristenpart, T., Shrimpton, T., Peek-a-boo, i still see you: Why efficient traffic analysis countermeasures fail (2012) Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, SP 2012, pp. 332-346. , IEEE Computer Society, Washington; Herzberg, A., Shulman, H., Ullrich, J., Weippl, E.R., Cloudoscopy: Services discovery and topology mapping (2013) Proceedings of the 2013 ACM Cloud Computing Security Workshop, CCSW 2013, pp. 113-122. , ACM; Liu, F., Yarom, Y., Ge, Q., Heiser, G., Lee, R.B., Last-level cache side-channel attacks are practical (2015) 2015 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 605-622; Miller, B., Huang, L., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., (2014) I Know Why You Went to the Clinic: Risks and Realization of HTTPS Traffic Analysis, , CoRR abs/1403.0297; Ristenpart, T., Tromer, E., Shacham, H., Savage, S., Hey, you, get off of my cloud: Exploring information leakage in third-party compute clouds (2009) Proceedings of the 2009 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 199-212. , ACM; Rohatgi, P., Side-channel attacks (2006) Handbook of Information Security, Threats, Vulnerabilities, Prevention, Detection, and Management, 3. , Wiley; Song, D.X., Wagner, D., Tian, X., Timing analysis of keystrokes and timing attacks on SSH (2001) 10Th USENIX Security Symposium.

The mechanism is efficient in the sense that under truthful reports it assigns the protection optimally. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,Decision theory; Adversarial environments; Fixed numbers; Incentive compatible mechanisms; Game theory,,,,,"Acemoglu, D., Malekian, A., Ozdaglar, A., (2013) Network Security and Contagion, , MIT Mimeo, New York; Aspnes, J., Chang, K., Yampolskiy, A., Inoculation strategies for victims of viruses and the sum-of-squares partition problem (2006) J.

We define an interactive oracle proof (IOP) to be an interactive proof in which the verifier is not required to read the prover’s messages in their entirety; rather, the verifier has oracle access to the prover’s messages, and may probabilistically query them. IOPs retain the expressiveness of PCPs, capturing NEXP rather than only PSPACE, and also the flexibility of IPs, allowing multiple rounds of communication with the prover. IOPs have already found several applications, including unconditional zero knowledge [BCGV16], constant-rate constant-query probabilistic checking [BCG+16], and doubly-efficient constant-round IPs for polynomial-time bounded-space computations [RRR16]. We offer two main technical contributions. First, we give a compiler that maps any public-coin IOP into a non-interactive proof in the random oracle model. We prove that the soundness of the resulting proof is tightly characterized by the soundness of the IOP against state restoration attacks, a class of rewinding attacks on the IOP verifier that is reminiscent of, but incomparable to, resetting attacks. Second, we study the notion of state-restoration soundness of an IOP: we prove tight upper and lower bounds in terms of the IOP’s (standard) soundness and round complexity; and describe a simple adversarial strategy that is optimal, in expectation, across all state restoration attacks. Our compiler can be viewed as a generalization of the Fiat–Shamir paradigm for public-coin IPs (CRYPTO ’86), and of the “CS proof” constructions of Micali (FOCS ’94) and Valiant (TCC ’08) for PCPs. Our analysis of the compiler gives, in particular, a unified understanding of these constructions, and also motivates the study of state restoration attacks, not only for IOPs, but also for IPs and PCPs. When applied to known IOP constructions, our compiler implies, e.g., blackbox unconditional ZK proofs in the random oracle model with quasilinear prover and polylogarithmic verifier, improving on a result of [IMSX15]. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2016.",,Cryptography; Polynomial approximation; Rate constants; Restoration; Interactive proofs; Non-interactive proof; Probabilistically checkable proof; Random Oracle model; Round complexity; State restoration; Technical contribution; Upper and lower bounds; Program compilers,,,,,"Arora, S., Lund, C., Motwani, R., Sudan, M., Szegedy, M., (1992) Proof Verification and Hardness of Approximation Problems; Arora, S., Lund, C., Motwani, R., Sudan, M., Szegedy, M., Proof verification and the hardness of approximation problems (1998) JACM, 45 (3), pp. 501-555; Arora, S., Safra, S., Probabilistic checking of proofs: A new characterization of NP (1998) JACM, 45 (1), pp. 70-122; Babai, L., Trading group theory for randomness (1985) STOC 1985; Babai, L., (1990) E-Mail and the Unexpected Power of Interaction, , Technical report, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA; Bellare, M., Boldyreva, A., Palacio, A., An uninstantiable random-oraclemodel scheme for a hybrid-encryption problem (2004) EUROCRYPT 2004.

However, most prior work has based the resilience of these primitives on a poorly defined reduction to a known NP-complete problem. There has been little scrutiny of the adversarial model and little discussion of how to generate instances that are always hard. In this paper, we offer what we believe to be the first complete algorithm for generating resilient opaque constructs against static analysis. We base their resilience on the complexity of 3SAT instances with cn clauses for c = 6 and n distinct variables. We draw on existing theoretical bounds to show that these instances always require exponential time to defeat under formal notions of resolution complexity. This paper also explores in-depth the security of opaque constructs in real-world settings. We argue that the common theoretical model used in prior work (as well as our resilient opaque construction scheme) is too optimistic. It does not offer practical obfuscation against an adversary who tolerates some small false positive rate. We offer a heuristic-based attack to demonstrate this issue. Our results suggest that opaque constructs should be viewed with a high degree of skepticism until they can be proven secure under more useful theoretical models. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,Computational complexity; Security of data; Security systems; Construction scheme; Exponential time; False positive rates; Real world setting; Resolution complexity; Tamper proofing; Theoretical bounds; Theoretical modeling; Static analysis,,,,,"Agrawal, M., Kayal, N., Saxena, N., PRIMES is in P (2002) Ann.

The goal is to manipulate the view of some honest party in a way, that this honest party learns the private data of some other honest party. The adversary itself might not learn this data at all. This goal, and such attacks are significant because they create a liability to the first honest party to clean its systems from second honest party’s data; a task that may be highly non-trivial. Cleaning the systems is essential to prevent possible security leaks in future. Protecting against this goal essentially means achieving security against several non-cooperating adversaries, where only one adversary is active, representing the real attacker, and each other adversary is passive, corrupting only a single party. We formalize the adversarial goal by proposing an alternative notion of universal composability. We show how existing, conventionally secure multiparty protocols can be transformed to make them secure against the novel adversarial goal. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; ITS systems; Multi-party protocols; Non-trivial; Private data; Security leak; Universal composability; Data privacy,,,,,"Schneier, B., (2016) Data is a Toxic Asset, , https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/03/dataisatoxic.html; Canetti, R., Universally composable security: A new paradigm for cryptographic protocols (2001) FOCS, pp. 136-145. , IEEE Computer Society; Alwen, J., Katz, J., Maurer, U., Zikas, V., Collusion-preserving computation (2012) CRYPTO 2012.

Typically adversaries alter data under their control to cause a large divergence of distribution between training and test data. Existing state-of-the-art adversarial learning techniques try to address this problem in which there is only a single type of adversary. In practice, a learner often has to face multiple types of adversaries that may employ different attack tactics. In this paper, we tackle the challenges of multiple types of adversaries with a nested Stackelberg game framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework with extensive empirical results on both synthetic and real data sets. Our results demonstrate that the nested game framework offers more reliable defense against multiple types of attackers. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,Learning systems; Adversarial environments; Adversarial learning; Data mining applications; Different attacks; Game frameworks; Stackelberg Games; State of the art; Synthetic and real data; Data mining,,,,,"Lowd, D., Good word attacks on statistical spam filters (2005) Proceedings of the Second Conference on Email and Anti-Spam (CEAS); Globerson, A., Roweis, S., Nightmare at test time: Robust learning by feature deletion (2006) ICML, pp. 353-360. , ACM; El Ghaoui, L., Lanckriet, G.R.G., Natsoulis, G., (2003) Robust classification with interval data, , Technical report UCB/CSD-03-1279, EECS Department, University of California, Berkeley, October; Zhou, Y., Kantarcioglu, M., Thuraisingham, B., Xi, B., Adversarial support vector machine learning (2012) SIGKDD, pp. 1059-1067. , ACM; Lanckriet, G.R.G., Ghaoui, L.E., Bhattacharyya, C., Jordan, M.I., A robust minimax approach to classification (2002) J.

In this chapter, we discuss a random ceiling padding approach whose results are resistant to such adversarial knowledge. Recent studies show that a Web-based application may be inherently vulnerable to side-channel attacks which exploit unique packet sizes to identify sensitive user inputs from encrypted traffic. Existing solutions based on packet padding or packet-size rounding generally rely on the assumption that adversaries do not possess prior background knowledge about possible user inputs. In this chapter, we propose a novel random ceiling padding approach whose results are resistant to such adversarial knowledge. Specifically, the approach injects randomness into the process of forming padding groups, such that an adversary armed with background knowledge would still face sufficient uncertainty in estimating user inputs. We formally present a generic scheme and discuss two concrete instantiations. We then confirm the correctness and performance of our approach through both theoretic analysis and experiments with two real world applications. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,,,,,,"Chen, S., Wang, R., Wang, X., Zhang, K., Side-channel leaks in web applications: A reality today, a challenge tomorrow (2010) IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy ’10, pp. 191-206; Dwork, C., Differential privacy (2006) ICALP (2), pp. 1-12; Fung, B.C.M., Wang, K., Chen, R., Yu, P.S., Privacy-preserving data publishing: A survey of recent developments (2010) ACM Comput.

Securing these networks requires layers of sophisticated safeguards against intrusion. Intelligence pertaining to adversarial methodologies plays a critical role in assessing the ability of a system to ward against cyber attacks. Since there is no standard for criminal cyber activities, gathering real-time idiosyncratic data provides an invaluable asset for those seeking to protect their information. Honeypots allow a victim to monitor an intruder in the act, revealing the tools and methods used. By collecting information of the sources and destinations of different payloads, honeypot operators obtain information regarding black-hat tools and tactics. Frequently networked to functioning systems, a honeypot, however, can be a security hazard. A savvy adversary can use a compromised honeypot to leap onto a live server on the same network. Inadequate monitoring of honeypot traffic and activities increases the risk of theft for any data stored on the actual production host. Depending on the type of institution deploying the honeypot, actions that undermine the security of retained confidential data risk federal sanctions. Federal regulations assigning this heightened duty for data security can be seen in credit reporting agencies, health care providers, and financial institutions. Likewise, some state statutes have established affirmative duties for networked service providers such as honeypot operators; however, legal concerns extend beyond the protection of live confidential data. Though relevant laws may not have been drafted with emerging technologies in mind, they are nonetheless applicable. This research addresses the potential exposure of honeypot operators to downstream liability based on the third-party actions of adversaries accessing the honeypot. These risks encompass state and federal statutes as well as common law theories of negligence.",Cyber crime; Downstream liability; Honeypots; Legal duty; Legal issues; Negligence,Complex networks; Crime; Laws and legislation; Network layers; Risk perception; Cyber-crimes; Honeypots; Legal duties; Legal issues; Negligence; Computer crime,,,,,"American Law Institute, (1965) Restatement of Torts. 2nd Ed., , St. Paul: American Law Institute Publishers; (2015) Data Breach Charts, , http://www.bakerlaw.com/files/Uploads/Documents/Data%20Breach%20documents/Data_Breach_Charts.pdf; (2011) Bass v.

Many applications in WMN including multicast TV, audio and video conferencing, and multiplayer social gaming use multicast transmission. On the other hand, security in multicast transmissions is crucial, without which the network services are significantly disrupted. Existing secure routing protocols that address different active attacks are still vulnerable due to subtle nature of flaws in protocol design. Moreover, existing secure routing protocols assume that adversarial nodes cannot share an out-of-band communication channel which rules out the possibility of wormhole attack. In this paper, we propose SEMRAW (SEcure Multicast Routing Algorithm for Wireless mesh network) that is resistant against all known active threats including wormhole attack. SEMRAW employs digital signatures to prevent a malicious node from gaining illegitimate access to the message contents.

Therefore, it is crucial that each entity has the capability of safeguarding its security features on its own. Methods based on harnessing the random identification and authentication from the physical device and environment, such as physical unclonable functions (PUFs) and True Random Number Generators (TRNGs), if securely run, are promising primitives for protecting lightweight IoT devices. This paper presents the first Built-In-Self-Test scheme for on-the-fly evaluation of PUFs that can also be utilized for assessing the desired statistical properties of TRNGs. Unlike earlier known PUF evaluation suites that were software-based and offline, our methodology enables online assessment of the pertinent statistical and security properties all in hardware. Specifically, the BIST structure is designed to evaluate two main properties of PUFs: unpredictability and stability. Our work is the first online test suite that thoroughly evaluates the internal health of the entropy source of TRNGs along with the statistical properties of the generated bit stream. Comprehensive real-time evaluation by the BIST method is able to ensure robustness and security of both TRNG and PUF in the face of operational, structural, and environmental fluctuations due to variations, aging, or adversarial acts. Proof-of-concept implementation of our BIST methodology in FPGA demonstrates its reasonable overhead, effectiveness, and practicality. © 2015 IEEE.",BIST; Built-In-Self-Test; Hardware security; Internet of things; IoT; Physical Unclonable Functions; PUF; TRNG; True Random Number Generators,Cryptography; Function evaluation; Hardware; Hardware security; Internet; Internet of things; Number theory; Random number generation; Reconfigurable hardware; Built-in-self-test schemes; Environmental fluctuations; Environmental variations; Internet of Things (IOT); Sensitive informations; Statistical properties; TRNG; True randoms; Built-in self test,,,,,"Miorandi, D., Sicari, S., Pellegrini, F.D., Chlamtac, I., Internet of things: Vision, applications and research challenges (2012) Ad Hoc Netw., 10 (7), pp. 1497-1516; Xu, T., Wendt, J.B., Potkonjak, M., Security of iot systems: Design challenges and opportunities (2014) Proc IEEE/ACM Int.

In recent times, a plethora of readily available hacking tools have widened the adversarial attack surface to launch advanced malicious attacks. This entails the need to devise and deploy stronger security solutions including countermeasures that prevent, detect, and deter such attacks. The need for an efficient and effective mechanism for detecting network intrusions in real-time cannot be understated. Distributed pattern matching through information sharing between intrusion detection agents is one such approach towards identifying anomalous activity in a network. In this paper, a novel distributed pattern matching approach is proposed for detecting malicious network activities through first analyzing network traffic by detector agents, and subsequently exchanging information (subpattern) among detector agents in order to holistically identify anomalous network activities. The detection effectiveness of the proposed approach is studied using simulation conducted considering different pattern exchange hierarchies. Simulation results show that our approach yields high accuracies in intrusion detection with low false alarm rates.",Distributed information processing; Intrusion detection; Network security; Pattern matching,Mercury (metal); Network security; Pattern matching; Personal computing; Distributed information processing; Distributed patterns; Effective mechanisms; Hierarchical patterns; Information sharing; Network intrusion detection; Network intrusion detection systems; Security solutions; Intrusion detection,,,,,"Kolaczek, G., Juszczyszyn, K., Traffic and attack pattern analysis for multiagent distributed intrusion detection system (2007) 2007 International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Knowledge Engineering, , Chengdu, China; Baig, Z.A., Khan, A.I., A fault-tolerant scheme for detection of ddos attack patterns in cluster- based wireless sensor networks (2008) Sensor and Ad Hoc Networks: Theoretical and Algorithmic Aspects, pp. 277-296. , S.

The underlying game is a multicast game in a rooted undirected graph with nonnegative edge costs. A set of k terminal vertices or players need to establish connectivity with the root. The social optimum is the Minimum Steiner Tree. We are interested in situations where the designer has incomplete information about the input. We propose two different models, the adversarial and the stochastic. In both models, the designer has prior knowledge of the underlying metric but the requested subset of the players is not known and is activated either in an adversarial manner (adversarial model) or is drawn from a known probability distribution (stochastic model). In the adversarial model, the goal of the designer is to choose a single, universal cost-sharing protocol that has low Price of Anarchy (PoA) for all possible requested subsets of players. The main question we address is: to what extent can prior knowledge of the underlying metric help in the design? We first demonstrate that there exist classes of graphs where knowledge of the underlying metric can dramatically improve the performance of good network cost-sharing design. For outerplanar graph metrics, we provide a universal cost-sharing protocol with constant PoA, in contrast to protocols that, by ignoring the graph metric, cannot achieve PoA better than Ω(log k). Then, in our main technical result, we show that there exist graph metrics, for which knowing the underlying metric does not help and any universal protocol has PoA of Ω(log k), which is tight. We attack this problem by developing new techniques that employ powerful tools from extremal combinatorics, and more specifically Ramsey Theory in high dimensional hypercubes. Then we switch to the stochastic model, where each player is independently activated according to some probability distribution that is known to the designer. We show that there exists a randomized ordered protocol that achieves constant PoA. By using standard derandomization techniques, we produce a deterministic ordered protocol that achieves constant PoA. We remark, that the first result holds also for the black-box model, where the probabilities are not known to the designer, but is allowed to draw independent (polynomially many) samples.",,Cost effectiveness; Probability distributions; Stochastic systems; Extremal combinatorics; High-dimensional; Incomplete information; Outerplanar graph; Price of anarchy; Prior knowledge; Social optimums; Undirected graph; Stochastic models,,,,,"Abed, F., Correa, J.R., Huang, C., Optimal coordination mechanisms for multi-job scheduling games (2014) Algorithms - ESA 2014-22th Annual European Symposium, Wroclaw, Poland, September 8-10, 2014-Proceedings, pp. 13-24; Abed, F., Huang, C., Preemptive coordination mechanisms for unrelated machines (2012) Algorithms - ESA 2012-20th Annual European Symposium, Ljubljana, Slovenia, September 10-12, 2012.

The S-box in the existing block encryption algorithm is more energy consuming and unsuitable for resources-constrained UANs. In this paper, instead of S-box, we present a lightweight, 8-round iteration block cipher algorithm for UANs communication based on chaotic theory and increase the key space by changing the number of iteration round. We further propose secure network architecture of UANs. By analysis, our algorithm can resist brute-force searches and adversarial attacks. Simulation results show that, compared with traditional AES-128 and PRESENT algorithms, our cryptographic algorithm can make a good trade-off between security and overhead, has better energy efficiency, and applies to UANs. © 2016 Chunyan Peng et al.",,Algorithms; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Iterative methods; Network architecture; Network security; Underwater acoustics; Block cipher algorithms; Block encryption algorithm; Brute force search; Cryptographic algorithms; Number of iterations; Secure network architecture; Ultra lightweights; Underwater acoustic networks; Cryptography,,,,,"Callaway, E.H., (2003) Wireless Sensor Networks, Architectures and Protocols, , Auerbach Publications, Taylor&Francis, Boca Raton, Fla, USA; Liang, Q., Cheng, X., Underwater acoustic sensor networks: Target size detection and performance analysis (2009) Ad Hoc Networks, 7 (4), pp. 803-808; Hu, Z.-J., Wang, C.-M., Zhu, Y.-P., Signal detection for the underwater acoustic voice communication (2003) Proceedings of the International Symposium on Test and Measurement, pp. 1-5. , IEEE, Washington, DC, USA; Preisig, J., Acoustic propagation considerations for underwater acoustic communications network development (2006) Proceedings of the 1st ACM International Workshop on Underwater Networks (WUWNet '06), 11, pp. 1-5. , September; Kilfoyle, D.B., Baggeroer, A.B., The state of the art in underwater acoustic telemetry (2000) IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering, 25 (1), pp. 4-27; Zhongwen, G., Hanjiang, L., Feng, H., Meng, Y., Ni, L.M., Current progress and research issues in underwater sensor networks (2010) Journal of Computer Research and Development, 47 (3), pp. 377-389; Caiti, A., Munafo, A., Adaptive cooperative algorithms for AUV networks (2010) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC '10), pp. 1-5. , Capetown, South Africa, May; Akyildiz, I.F., Pompili, D., Melodia, T., State-of-The-art in protocol research for underwater acoustic sensor networks (2006) Proceedings of the 1st ACM International Workshop on Underwater Networks (WUWNe '06), pp. 7-16. , ACM, NewYork, NY, USA, September; Rice, J., Green, D., Underwater acoustic communications andnetworks for theUSNavy's seawebprogram (2008) InProceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Sensor Technologies and Applications (SENSORCOMM '08), pp. 715-722. , IEEE, Cap Esterel, France, August; Cui, J.-H., Kong, J., Gerla, M., Zhou, S., The challenges of building scalable mobile underwater wireless sensor networks for aquatic applications (2006) IEEE Network, 20 (3), pp. 12-18; Xie, P., Zhou, Z., Peng, Z., Cui, J.-H., Shi, Z., SDRT: A reliable data transport protocol for underwater sensor networks (2010) Ad Hoc Networks, 8 (7), pp. 708-722; Su, Y., Zhu, Y., Mo, H., UPC-MAC: A power control mac protocol for underwater sensor networks (2013) Wireless Algorithms, Systems, and Applications, pp. 377-390. , Springer, Berlin, Germany; Stojanovic, M., (2008) Underwater Acoustic Communication: Design Considerations on the Physical Layer, , Wireless on Demand Network Systems and Services; Shin, S.Y., Namgung, J.I., Park, S.H., SBMAC: Smart blockingMACmechanism for variableUW-ASN(underwater acoustic sensor network) environment (2010) Sensors, 10 (1), pp. 501-525; Paul, A., Chen, D.B., Wang, W., Bioinspiredmechanisms in wireless Ad Hoc and sensor networks (2015) Journal of Sensors, 2015, 2p; Yun, N.-Y., Kim, Y.-P., Muminov, S., Lee, J.-Y., Shin, S.-Y., Park, S.-H., Sync MAC protocol to control underwater vehicle based on underwater acoustic communication (2011) Proceedings of the IEEE/IFIP 9th International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing (EUC '11), pp. 452-456. , Melbourne, Australia, October; Dong, Y., Liu, P., Security considerations of underwater acoustic networks (2010) Proceedings of the 20th International Congress on Acoustics (ICA '10), pp. 274-277. , Sydney, Australia, August; Parr, C., Poschmann, A., Robshaw, M.J.B., New designs in lightweight symmetric encryption (2008) RFID Security: Techniques, pp. 349-371. , Protocols and System-on-Chip Design, P.

While targeted attacks are often publicly reported, there is no clear information regarding nontargeted attacks. In order to analyse potentially malicious behaviour, we develop a large-scale honeynet system to capture and investigate network activities that use industrial protocols. The honeynet is composed of multiple honeypots that can be automatically deployed to cloud infrastructures as well as on-premises networks, and employs a modular design to support a multitude of industrial protocols. The collected data is aggregated at a series of centralised yet redundant nodes to resist single points of failure or adversarial compromise. We deploy the honeynet to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and present our observations. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",Honeypots; Industrial control system security; SCADA security,Control systems; Electronic commerce; Cloud infrastructures; Honeypots; Industrial control systems; Industrial protocols; Modular designs; Network activities; Redundant nodes; SCADA security; Network security,,,,,"Asgarkhani, M., Sitnikova, E., A strategic approach to managing security in SCADA systems (2014) Proceedings of the 13Th European Conference on Cyber Warefare and Security, pp. 23-32. , Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited, July; Beale, J., Baker, A., Esler, J., Kohlenberg, T., Northcutt, S., Snort: IDS and IPS Toolkit.

However, when transactions are concurrent, say over the Internet, with players possessing public keys (as is common in cryptography), assuring that entities “know” what they claim to know, where adversaries may be well coordinated across different transactions, turns out to be much more subtle and in need of re-examination. In such settings, mixing the public-key structure as part of the language and statements is a natural adversarial strategy. Here, we investigate how to formally treat knowledge possession by parties interacting concurrently in the public-key model. More technically, we look into the relative power of the notion of “concurrent knowledge extraction” (CKE) for concurrent zero knowledge (CZK) in the bare public-key (BPK) model, where the language and statements being proved can be dynamically and adaptively chosen by the prover and may be possibly based on verifiers’ public keys. By concrete attacks against some existing natural protocols, we first show that concurrent soundness and normal arguments of knowledge do not guarantee concurrent verifier security in the public-key setting. Here, roughly speaking, concurrent verifier security says that the malicious concurrent prover should “know"" all the witnesses to all the possibly public-key-related statements adaptively chosen and successfully proved in the concurrent sessions. These concrete attacks serve as a good motivation for understanding “possession of knowledge” for concurrent transactions with registered public keys, i.e., the subtleties of concurrent knowledge extraction in the public-key model. This motivates us to introduce and formalize the notion of CKE, along with clarifications of various subtleties. Two implementations are then presented for constant-round concurrently knowledge extractable concurrent zero-knowledge (CZK–CKE) argument for NP in the BPK model: One protocol is generic and based on standard polynomial-time assumptions, whereas the other protocol is computationally efficient and employs complexity leveraging in a novel way. Both protocols can be practically instantiated for some specific number-theoretic languages without going through general NP-reductions. Of independent interest are the discussions about the subtleties surrounding the fundamental structure of Feige–Shamir zero knowledge in the BPK model. © 2014, International Association for Cryptologic Research.",Bare public key; Complexity leveraging; Proof of knowledge; Strong witness indistinguishability; Witness-extended emulator; Zero knowledge,Computational complexity; Concretes; Electronic document identification systems; Extraction; Polynomial approximation; Complexity leveraging; Proof of knowledge; Public keys; Witness indistinguishability; Witness-extended emulator; Zero knowledge; Knowledge management,,,,,"Barak, B., How to Go Beyond the Black-Box Simulation Barrier (2001) In IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, pp. 106-115; Barak, B., Canetti, R., Nielsen, J.B., Pass, R., UniversallyComposable Protocols with Relaxed Set-Up Assumptions (2004) In IEEESymposium on Foundations of Computer Science, pp. 186-195; Barak, B., Goldreich, O., Universal Arguments and Their Applications (2002) In IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity, pp. 194-203; Barak, B., Goldreich, O., Goldwasser, S., Lindell, Y., Resettably-Sound Zero-Knowledge and Its Applications (2001) In IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, pp. 116-125; Barak, B., Lindell, Y., Strict Polynomial-Time in Simulation andExtraction (2004) SIAM Journal on Computing, 33 (4), pp. 783-818; Barak, B., Lindell, Y., Lower Bounds for Non-Black-Box Zero-Knowledge (2006) Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 72 (2), pp. 321-391; Barak, B., Prabhakaran, M., Sahai, A., Concurrent Non-Malleable Zero-Knowledge (2006) FOCS, pp. 345-354; Bellare, M., Goldreich, O., On Defining Proofs of Knowledge In E.
