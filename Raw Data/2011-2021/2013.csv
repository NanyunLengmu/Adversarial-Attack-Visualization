A typical cloudoscopy attack is composed of a number of steps: first expose the internal IP address of a victim instance, then measure its hop-count distance from adversarial cloud instances, and finally test to find a specific instance which is close enough to the victim (e.g., co-resident) to allow (denial of service or side-channel) attacks. We refer to the three steps/modules involved in such cloudoscopy attack by the terms IP address deanonymisation, hop-count measuring, and co-residence testing. We present specific methods for these three cloudoscopy modules, and report on results of our experimental validation on popular cloud platform providers. Our techniques can be used for attacking (victim) servers, as well as for benign goals, e.g., optimisation of instances placement and communication, or comparing clouds and validating cloud-provider placement guarantees. © 2013 ACM.",cloud mapping; cloud security; cloud tomography; low rate attacks; socket overloading,Cloud securities; Denial of Service; Experimental validations; Low rates; Sensitive informations; Services discovery; socket overloading; Topology mapping; Security of data; Cloud computing,,,,,"Aciiçmez, O., Brumley, B.B., Grabher, P., New results on instruction cache attacks (2010) Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems, CHES 2010, pp. 110-124. , Springer; Ballani, H., Jang, K., Karagiannis, T., Kim, C., Gunawardena, D., O'Shea, G., Chatty tenants and the cloud network sharing problem (2013) Proceedings of the 10th USENIX Conference on Networked Systems Design and Implementation, pp. 171-184. , USENIX Association; Bates, A., Mood, B., Pletcher, J., Pruse, H., Valafar, M., Butler, K., Detecting co-residency with active traffic analysis techniques (2012) Proceedings of the 2012 ACM Workshop on Cloud Computing Security Workshop, pp. 1-12. , ACM; Ben-Yehuda, M., Day, M.D., Dubitzky, Z., Factor, M., Har'El, N., Gordon, A., Liguori, A., Yassour, B.-A., The turtles project: Design and implementation of nested virtualization (2010) OSDI, 10, pp. 423-436; Bowers, K.D., Van Dijk, M., Juels, A., Oprea, A., Rivest, R.L., How to tell if your cloud files are vulnerable to drive crashes (2011) Proceedings of the 18th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 501-514. , ACM; Bugiel, S., Nürnberger, S., Sadeghi, A.-R., Schneider, T., Twin clouds: An architecture for secure cloud computing Workshop on Cryptography and Security in Clouds (WCSC 2011), 2011; Chen, P., Xu, D., Mao, B., Clouder: A framework for automatic software vulnerability location and patching in the cloud (2012) Proceedings of the 7th ACM Symposium on Information, Computer and Communications Security, pp. 50-50. , ACM; Chow, R., Golle, P., Jakobsson, M., Shi, E., Staddon, J., Masuoka, R., Molina, J., Controlling data in the cloud: Outsourcing computation without outsourcing control (2009) Proceedings of the 2009 ACM Workshop on Cloud Computing Security, pp. 85-90. , ACM; Coates, A., Hero III, A.O., Nowak, R., Yu, B., Internet tomography (2002) Signal Processing Magazine, IEEE, 19 (3), pp. 47-65; De Capitani Di Vimercati, S., Foresti, S., Samarati, P., Managing and accessing data in the cloud: Privacy risks and approaches (2012) Risk and Security of Internet and Systems (CRiSIS), 2012 7th International Conference on, pp. 1-9. , IEEE; Gasti, P., Ateniese, G., Blanton, M., Deniable cloud storage: Sharing files via public-key deniability (2010) Proceedings of the 9th Annual ACM Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society, pp. 31-42. , ACM; Gullasch, D., Bangerter, E., Krenn, S., Cache games-bringing access-based cache attacks on aes to practice (2011) Security and Privacy (SP), 2011 IEEE Symposium on, pp. 490-505. , IEEE; Herzberg, A., Shulman, H., Stealth DoS attacks on secure channels Proc.

A formal security model for PRNGs with input was proposed in 2005 by Barak and Halevi (BH). This model involves an internal state that is refreshed with a (potentially biased) external random source, and a cryptographic function that outputs random numbers from the continually internal state. In this work we extend the BH model to also include a new security property capturing how it should accumulate the entropy of the input data into the internal state after state compromise. This property states that a good PRNG should be able to eventually recover from compromise even if the entropy is injected into the system at a very slow pace, and expresses the real-life expected behavior of existing PRNG designs. Unfortunately, we show that neither the model nor the specific PRNG construction proposed by BH meet this new property, despite meeting a weaker robustness notion introduced by BH. From a practical side, we give a precise assessment of the Linux PRNGs, /dev/random and /dev/urandom. In particular, we show attacks proving that these PRNGs are not robust according to our definition, due to vulnerabilities in their entropy estimator and their internal mixing function. Finally, we propose a simple PRNG construction that is provably robust in our new and stronger adversarial model and we show that it is more efficient than the Linux PRNGs. We therefore recommend to use this construction whenever a PRNG with input is used for cryptography. © 2013 ACM.",/dev/random; entropy; randomness; security models,/dev/random; Cryptographic functions; Deterministic algorithms; Formal security models; Pseudo random number generators; randomness; Security model; Security properties; Algorithms; Computer operating systems; Cryptography; Entropy; Security of data; Random number generation,,,,,"Barak, B., Halevi, S., A model and architecture for pseudo-random generation with applications to /dev/random ACM CCS 05: 12th Conference on Computer and Communications Security (Nov. 2005), pp. 203-212. , V.

In this paper, we consider two aspects of OpenFlow that pose security challenges, and we propose two solutions that could address these concerns. The first challenge is the inherent communication bottleneck that arises between the data plane and the control plane, which an adversary could exploit by mounting a ""control plane saturation attack"" that disrupts network operations. Indeed, even well-mined adversarial models, such as scanning or denial-of-service (DoS) activity, can produce more potent impacts on OpenFlow networks than traditional networks. To address this challenge, we introduce an extension to the OpenFlow data plane called ""connection migration"", which dramatically reduces the amount of data-to-control-plane interactions that arise during such attacks. The second challenge is that of enabling the control plane to expedite both detection of, and responses to, the changing flow dynamics within the data plane. For this, we introduce ""actuating triggers"" over the data plane's existing statistics collection services. These triggers are inserted by control layer applications to both register for asynchronous call backs, and insert conditional flow rules that are only activated when a trigger condition is detected within the data plane's statistics module. We present Avant-Guard, an implementation of our two data plane extensions, evaluate the performance impact, and examine its use for developing more scalable and resilient SDN security services. © 2013 ACM.",control plane saturation attack; openflow; security and resilience; software-defined network (sdn),Connection migration; Openflow; Reference implementation; Saturation attacks; security and resilience; Security challenges; Software defined networking (SDN); Software-defined networks; Security of data,,,,,"Benton, K., Camp, L.J., Small, C., Openflow vulnerability assessment Proceedings of the Second ACM SIGCOMM Workshop on Hot Topics in Software Defined Networking (HotSDN), 2013; Bernstein, D.J., SYN Cookies, , http://cr.yp.to/syncookies.html; Braga, R.S., Mota, E., Passito, A., Lightweight DDoS Flooding Attack Detection Using NOX/OpenFlow Proceedings of the 35th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN), 2010; Casado, M., Freedman, M.J., Pettit, J., Luo, J., McKeown, N., Shenker, S., Ethane: Taking Control of the Enterprise Proceedings of ACM SIGCOMM, 2007; Casado, M., Garfinkel, T., Freedman, M., Akella, A., Boneh, D., McKeowon, N., Shenker, S., SANE: A Protection Architecture for Enterprise Networks Proceedings of the Usenix Security Symposium, August 2006; Cisco Guard Anomaly Detector, , http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/modules/ps2706/ps6235/ produc%t_data_sheet0900aecd80220a7c.html; Curtis, A., Mogul, J., Tourrilhes, J., Yalagandula, P., Sharma, P., Banerjee, S., DevoFlow: Scaling Flow Management for High-Performance Networks Proceedings of ACM SIGCOMM, 2011; Greenberg, A., Hjalmtysson, G., Maltz, D.A., Myers, A., Rexford, J., Xie, G., Yan, H., Zhang, H., A Clean Slate 4D Approach to Network Control and Management Proceedings of ACM Computer Communications Review, 2005; Gu, G., Chen, Z., Porras, P., Lee, W., Misleading and Defeating Importance-Scanning Malware Propagation Proceedings of International Conference on Security and Privacy in Communication Networks (SecureComm), 2007; Jafarian, J.H., Al-Shaer, E., Duan, Q., Openflow Random Host Mutation: Transparent Moving Target Defense using Software Defined Networking Proceedings of the 1st ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Software Defined Networks (HotSDN), 2012; Jeffrey, P.C., Mogul, C., Hey, You Darned Counters!

In such domains, attackers modify their behavior to evade the classifier while accomplishing their goals as efficiently as possible. The attackers typically do not know the exact classifier parameters, but they may be able to evade it by observing the classifier's behavior on test instances that they construct. For example, spammers may learn the most effective ways to modify their spams by sending test emails to accounts they control. This problem setting has been formally analyzed for linear classifiers with discrete features and convex-inducing classifiers with continuous features, but never for non-linear classifiers with discrete features. In this paper, we extend previous ACRE learning results to convex polytopes representing unions or intersections of linear classifiers. We prove that exponentially many queries are required in the worst case, but that when the features used by the component classifiers are disjoint, previous attacks on linear classifiers can be adapted to efficiently attack them. In experiments, we further analyze the cost and number of queries required to attack different types of classifiers. These results move us closer to a comprehensive understanding of the relative vulnerability of different types of classifiers to malicious adversaries. © 2013 ACM.",adversarial machine learning; spam,Component classifiers; Continuous features; Linear classifiers; Machine learning applications; Malicious adversaries; Malicious behavior; Nonlinear classifiers; spam; Learning systems; Artificial intelligence,,,,,"Biggio, B., Corona, I., Maiorca, D., Nelson, B., Srndic, N., Laskov, P., Giacinto, G., Roli, F., Evasion attacks against machine learning at test time (2013) European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD), , Springer; Biggio, B., Fumera, G., Roli, F., Multiple classifier systems for adversarial classification tasks (2009) Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Multiple Classifier Systems, pp. 132-141. , Springer; Chau, D., Pandit, S., Faloutsos, C., Detecting fraudulent personalities in networks of online auctioneers (2006) Knowledge Discovery in Databases: PKDD 2006, pp. 103-114; Cormack, G., Lynam, T., Spam corpus creation for trec (2005) Stanford University; Cranor, L.F., LaMacchia, B.A., Spam!

However, they have not been originally devised to deal with deliberate attack attempts that may aim to subvert the clustering process itself. Whether clustering can be safely adopted in such settings remains thus questionable. In this work we propose a general framework that allows one to identify potential attacks against clustering algorithms, and to evaluate their impact, by making specific assumptions on the adversary's goal, knowledge of the attacked system, and capabilities of manipulating the input data. We show that an attacker may significantly poison the whole clustering process by adding a relatively small percentage of attack samples to the input data, and that some attack samples may be obfuscated to be hidden within some existing clusters. We present a case study on single-linkage hierarchical clustering, and report experiments on clustering of malware samples and handwritten digits. © 2013 ACM.",adversarial learning; clustering; computer security; malware detection; security evaluation; unsupervised learning,Adversarial learning; clustering; Clustering process; Handwritten digit; Hier-archical clustering; Malware detection; Security application; Security evaluation; Artificial intelligence; Cluster analysis; Computer crime; Input output programs; Security of data; Unsupervised learning; Clustering algorithms,,,,,"Collaborative Malware Collection and Sensing, , https://alliance.mwcollect.org; http://malfease.oarci.net, Project Malfease; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., Can machine learning be secure?

Distributed estimation is where the state of the energy system is to be estimated via a collection of geographically dispersed sensors. In order to implement the estimator, the sensors, in addition to sensing, implement a simple data fusion protocol that relies on inter-sensor communication. We study estimation of energy systems when there is an adversarial attack on the sensed and communicated information. We propose a novel methodology to address the detection of such attacks, and further incorporate appropriate remedial actions in the estimator. Our methodology is based on the notions of local consistency and nodal consistency and is further reinforced by exploiting the underlying physical-layer in the energy-system description. © 2013 IEEE.",,Cyber physicals; Cyber security; Distributed estimation; Energy systems; Fusion protocol; Local consistency; Novel methodology; Remedial actions; Computer simulation; Data fusion; Sensors; Estimation,,,,,"Sha, L., Gopalakrishnan, S., Liu, X., Wang, Q., Cyber-physical systems: A new frontier (2009) Machine Learning in Cyber Trust, pp. 3-13. , Springer US; Stankovíc, J.A., Lee, I., Mok, A., Rajkumar, R., Opportunities and obligations for physical computing systems (2005) Computer, 38 (11), pp. 23-31. , Nov; Ćardenas, A.A., Amin, S., Sastry, S., Research challenges for the security of control systems (2008) Proceedings of the 3rd Conference on Hot Topics in Security, pp. 1-6. , Berkeley, CA, USA; Fleury, T., Khurana, H., Welch, V., Towards a taxonomy of attacks against energy control systems (2009) Critical Infrastructure Protection II, 290, pp. 71-85. , M.

We propose that designers of such systems broaden the classification goal into an explanatory goal, which would deepen the interaction with system's operators. To provide guidance, we advocate for an approach based on maintaining one classifier for each class of unwanted activity to be filtered. We also emphasize the necessity for the system to be responsive to the operators constant curation of the training set. We show how this paradigm provides a property we call isolation and how it relates to classical causative attacks. In order to demonstrate the effects of drift on a binary classification task, we also report on two experiments using a previously unpublished malware data set where each instance is timestamped according to when it was seen. © 2013 ACM.",adversarial machine learning; concept drift; malware classification,Adversarial environments; Binary classification; Concept drifts; Feature engineerings; Machine-learning; Malware classifications; Position papers; Provide guidances; Computer crime; Learning systems; Artificial intelligence,,,,,"Bayer, U., Comparetti, P.M., Kruegel, C.H.C., Kirda, E., Scalable, behavior-based malware clustering (2009) NDSS; Biggio, B., Corona, I., Fumera, G., Bagging classifiers for fighting poisoning attacks in adversarial classification tasks (2011) Multiple Classifier Systems, pp. 350-359. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg; Biggio, B., Fumera, G., Roli, F., Evade hard multiple classifier systems (2009) Applications of Supervised and Unsupervised Ensemble Methods, pp. 15-38. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg; Bottou, L., Bousquet, O., The Tradeoffs of Large-Scale Learning (2008) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 20, pp. 161-168; Brückner, M., Kanzow, C., Scheffer, T., Static prediction games for adversarial learning problems (2012) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 13, pp. 2617-2654; Brückner, M., Scheffer, T., Stackelberg games for adversarial prediction problems (2011) Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 547-555; Castelli, V., Cover, T.M., On the exponential value of labeled samples (1995) Pattern Recognition Letters, 16; Cretu, G.F., Stavrou, A., Locasto, M.E., Stolfo, S.J., Keromytis, A.D., Casting out demons: Sanitizing training data for anomaly sensors (2008) Security and Privacy, 2008.

IMDs, which include pacemakers and cardiac defibrillators, are therapeutic medical devices partially or wholly embedded in the human body. They often have built-in radio communication to facilitate non-invasive reprogramming and data readout. Many IMDs, though, lack well designed authentication protocols, exposing patients to over-the-air attack and physical harm. H2H makes use of ECG (heartbeat data) as an authentication mechanism, ensuring access only by a medical instrument in physical contact with an IMD-bearing patient. Based on statistical analysis of real-world data, we propose and analyze new techniques for extracting time-varying randomness from ECG signals for use in H2H. We introduce a novel cryptographic device pairing protocol that uses this randomness to protect against attacks by active adversaries, while meeting the practical challenges of lightweight implementation and noise tolerance in ECG readings. Finally, we describe an end-to-end implementation in an ARM-Cortex M-3 microcontroller that demonstrates the practicality of H2H in current IMD hardware. Previous schemes have had goals much like those of H2H, but with serious limitations making them unfit for deployment - -such as naively designed cryptographic pairing protocols (some of them recently broken). In addition to its novel analysis and use of ECG entropy, H2H is the first physiologically- based IMD device pairing protocol with a rigorous adversarial model and protocol analysis. © 2013 ACM.",imd security; implantable medical devices; security protocols,Authentication mechanisms; Authentication protocols; Cryptographic devices; imd security; Implantable medical devices; Implanted medical devices; Medical instruments; Security protocols; Authentication; Cryptography; Electrocardiography; Heart; Network security; Physiological models; Random processes; Biomedical equipment,,,,,"Goldberger, A.L., PhysioBank, PhysioToolkit, and PhysioNet: Components of a new research resource for complex physiologic signals (2000) Circulation, 101 (23); (2012) Physical Activity and Blood Pressure, , American Heart Association; Bao, S.D., Poon, C.C.Y., Zhang, Y.T., Shen, L.F., Using the timing information of heartbeats as an entity identifier to secure body sensor network (2008) IEEE Trans. on Info.

This makes it an appealing defensive technique for environments such as the nation's critical infrastructure that is currently facing increased cyber adversarial activity. When considering deployment within the purview of such critical infrastructures it is imperative that the technology is well understood and reliable, where its performance is benchmarked on the results of principled assessments. This paper works towards such an imperative by analyzing the current state of anomaly detector assessments with a view toward mission critical deployments. We compile a framework of key evaluation constructs that identify how and where current assessment methods may fall short in providing sufficient insight into detector performance characteristics. Within the context of three case studies from literature, we show how error factors that influence the performance of detectors interact with different phases of a canonical evaluation strategy to compromise the integrity of the final results. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.",Anomaly Detector Evaluation; Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection; Error Taxonomy,Anomaly detection; Anomaly detector; Anomaly-based intrusion detection; Detector performance; Error taxonomy; Evaluation strategies; Intrusion detectors; Mission critical; Critical infrastructures; Intrusion detection; Public works; Research; Detectors,,,,,"Denning, D.E., An Intrusion-Detection Model (1987) IEEE Trans.

Pairwise key establishment is one of the fundamental issues in securing WMNs. This paper presents a new matrix based pairwise key establishment scheme. Mesh client in our scheme only needs to prestore a key seed, which can be used to generate a column of secret matrix. It can establish pairwise keys with other clients after mesh routers broadcast public matrices. Our scheme is motivated by the fact that in WMNs, mesh routers are more powerful than mesh clients, both in computation and communication. Besides, we employ the pre deployment knowledge to reduce the computational cost of mesh clients. Security and complexity analysis show that the new scheme possesses several desirable features: 1) neighbor mesh clients can directly establish pairwise keys; 2) the newscheme is updatable, scalable, and robust against node capture attacks; and 3) communication and storage costs at mesh clients are signifcantly reduced. © 2013 IEEE.",Deployment knowledge; Matrix; Pairwise key; Wireless mesh networks; Wireless sensor networks,Complex networks; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Matrix algebra; Mesh generation; Wireless mesh networks (WMN); Wireless sensor networks; Complexity analysis; Computational costs; Deployment knowledge; Desirable features; Node capture attack; Pair-wise keys; Wireless Mesh networks (WMNs); Wireless transmissions; MESH networking,,,,,"Akyildiz, I.F., Wang, X., A survey on wireless mesh networks (2005) IEEE Commun.

These systems need to synchronize the receiver and equalize the channel to achieve good performance. The algorithms used to perform timing synchronization and channel estimation/equalization typically are designed without considering whether an adversarial signal could disrupt these subsystems. In typical scenarios, a jammer would not have reliable (or any) knowledge of the channels filtering the target or jamming signals. Thus, in this paper, we consider attack strategies that do not require channel knowledge. We study the efficiency of several jamming strategies targeting each subsystem as measured by the peak and average signal-to-jamming ratio (SJR) required to achieve signal denial for each method and find that jamming the timing can be substantially more efficient than other jamming strategies. We also discuss modifications to the jamming strategies that might be necessary for real-world operation. © 2013 IEEE.",Jamming; OFDM; Pilot tones; Synchronization,Attack strategies; Channel estimation/equalization; Channel information; Communications systems; Jamming strategies; Pilot tone; Signal-to-jamming ratio; Timing synchronization; Military communications; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Synchronization; Jamming,,,,,"Poisel, R., Jamming techniques (2011) Modern Communications Jamming: Principles and Techniques, pp. 467-511. , 2nd Ed.

Consumer electronic devices have evolved depending on user needs. Users want to use compact and portable devices such as cellular phones, laptop computers, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), etc. anywhere and at anytime to download multimedia data or to access realtime traffic. The mobile Ad Hoc networks have several salient characteristics, such as Dynamic topologies, Bandwidth-constrained, Variable capacity links, Energy-constrained operation and Limited physical security. Due to these features, mobile Ad Hoc networks are particularly vulnerable to denial of service attacks launched through compromised node. The communication in mobile AdHoc networks comprises of two phases, the route discovery and the data transmission. In a hostile environment, adversarial nodes can try to disrupt communication in both the two phases. However, consumer electronic devices generally operate on limited battery power and therefore are vulnerable to security threats like data flooding attacks. Flooding attack is a novel and powerful attack against on-demand Ad Hoc routing protocols. At present, FAP (Flooding Attack Prevention) is the single scheme proposed to resist such attack. But it may not give quality of service. In this paper, we present a Period Based Defense mechanism against data flooding attack in wireless AdHoc network. This is the new technique to defend the flooding attack. This scheme is based on the periods and uses a blacklist to efficiently prevent the data flooding attack. The main aim of this paper is to enhance the throughput of burst traffic. As a result of which, many data packets are forwarded at a high rate for the whole duration. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme enhances the throughput of burst traffic. © 2013 IEEE.",Burst traffic; Data flooding attack; Throughput; Wireless ad hoc network,,,,,,"Kim, H., Chitti, R.B., Song, J., (2010) Novel Defense Mechanism Against Data Flooding Attacks in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks, , IEEE; Lee, S.-J., Gerla, M., The Split Multipath Routing with Maximally Disjoint Paths in Ad Hoc Networks for Multiple Route""s; Hu, Y.-C., Perrig, A., Johnson, D.B., Wormhole attacks in wireless network (2006) IEEE; Steven, Y.G., Ranger, G., A novel intrusion detection system architecture for mobile ad hoc networks (2006) IEEE; Manpreet, A.V., Gujral, S., A comprehensive appraisal of ad hoc networks (2012) International Journal of Computer Applications (0975-8887), 49 (22). , July","Bahaddur, I.; Dept. of Electronics and Communication Engineering, , Hassan, India; 电子邮件: indira_b15@rediffmail.com",,,,"2013 4th International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies, ICCCNT 2013",4 July 2013 through 6 July 2013,Tiruchengode,102800,,9.78148E+12,,,English,"Int.

Previous work shows that it is possible for a network to automatically recover, even when an adversary repeatedly deletes nodes in the network. However, there have not yet been any algorithms that self-heal in the case where an adversary takes over nodes in the network. In this paper, we address this gap. In particular, we describe a communication network over n nodes that ensures the following properties, even when an adversary controls up to t ≤ (1/8 - ε)n nodes, for any non-negative ε. First, the network provides a point-to-point communication with bandwidth and latency costs that are asymptotically optimal. Second, the expected total number of message corruptions is O(t(log* n)2) before the adversarially controlled nodes are effectively quarantined so that they cause no more corruptions. Empirical results show that our algorithm can reduce bandwidth cost by up to a factor of 70. © Springer International Publishing 2013.",Byzantine faults; Self-healing algorithms; Threshold cryptography,,,,,,"Boman, I., Saia, J., Abdallah, C.T., Schamiloglu, E., Brief announcement: Self-healing algorithms for reconfigurable networks (2006) LNCS, 4280, pp. 563-565. , Datta, A.K., Gradinariu, M.

The ability to respond appropriately to a cyber attack in a timely and effective manner has never been more important. Unfortunately, decision-making uncertainty following a cyber attack can hinder and delay critical response options including the use of force. A review of the literature indicated the decision-making uncertainty experienced by senior military officers was described by five interdependent characteristics: response process, human factors, governance, technology, and environment. Furthermore, the response decision-making process used by military officers following a cyber attack was best characterized by poliheuristic, noncompensatory decision theory. The literature also suggested that poliheuristic theory as originally formulated failed to incorporate two key elements of the decision-making process, specifically leadership styles and situational context. Accordingly, this qualitative, directed content analysis was used to validate published research findings that certain leadership characteristics and situational variables affect the poliheuristic decisionmaking process that senior military officers use when determining the appropriate response to a cyber attack. A directed content analysis was used to examine previously collected interview data from 21 senior military officers who served for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in cyber warfare divisions in Washington, DC. The results of this research study supported and triangulated the findings in the literature that leadership styles and situational context are necessary additions to a more comprehensive poliheuristic theory that has improved predictive and explanatory power. The research study also showed that senior military officers' leadership styles are more use of force oriented than politically oriented with adversarial distrust and military assertiveness being the predominate themes. Finally, the research study results revealed generational and organizational cultural effects, ethical considerations, and anticipatory skills influence leadership style and decision-making following a cyber attack.",Cyberspace; Decision-making; Leadership; Poliheuristic; Situational; Warfare,Cyberspaces; Decision making process; Ethical considerations; Information networks; Leadership; Poliheuristic; Situational; Situational context; Computer crime; Crime; Decision theory; Digital control systems; Information services; Military operations; Research; Semantics; Decision making,,,,,"Brule, D.J., Explaining and forecasting leaders' decisions: A poliheuristic analysis of the Iran hostage rescue decision (2005) International Studies Perspectives, 6 (1), pp. 99-113; Bryman, A., Bresnen, M., Beardsworth, A., Keil, T., Qualitative research and the study of leadership (1988) Human Relations, 41 (1), pp. 13-30; Bumiller, E., Shanker, T., Panetta warns of dire threat of cyberattack on U.S (2012), The New York Times, October 11, 2012; Bush, G.W., The national strategy to secure cyberspace (2003), Washington, DC: The White House; Cartwright, J.E., Pace, P., Rumsfield, D.H., Deterrence operations: Joint operating concepts (v. 2.0) (2006), Washington, DC: Department of Defense; Caudle, D.L., Decision-making uncertainty and the use of force in cyberspace: A phenomenological study of military officers (2010), Doctor of Management Dissertation, School of Advanced Studies, University of Phoenix, ProQuest UMI 3438389; Cohen, M., Etner, J., Jeleva, M., Dynamic decision-making when risk perception depends on past experience (2008) Theory and Decision, 62 (2-3), pp. 173-192; Conger, J.A., Qualitative research as the cornerstone methodology for understanding leadership (1998) Leadership Quarterly, 9 (1), pp. 107-121; Denzin, N.K., The research act: A theoretical introduction to sociological methods (1978), New York, Praeger; Derouen, K., Presidents and the diversionary use of force: A research note (2000) International Studies Quarterly, 44 (2), pp. 317-328; Derouen, K., Sprecher, C., Initial crisis and poliheuristic theory (2004) Journal of Conflict Resolution, 48 (1), pp. 56-68; Fox, J., Arena, D., Bailenson, J.N., Virtual reality: A survival guide for the social scientist (2009) Journal of Media Psychology, 21 (3), pp. 95-113; Geers, K., Sun Tzu and cyber war (2011), Tallinn, Estonia: Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE); Gortney, W.E., Joint Publication 1-02: Department of Defense dictionary of military and assocaited terms (2012), Washington, DC: Joint Chiefs of Staff; Holosko, M.J., Primer for critiquing social research: A student guide (2006), Florence, KY, Cengage Learning; Hsieh, H.F., Shannon, S.E., Three approaches to qualitative content analysis (2005) Qualitative Health Research, 15 (9), pp. 1277-1288; Humble, A.M., Technique triangulation for validation in directed content analysis (2009) International Journal of Qualitative Methods, 8 (3), pp. 34-51; Jackson, W., U.S. understanding of cyber war still immature, says former NSA director (2010), Government Computer News [Online]; Keinan, G., Decision-making understress: Scanning of alternatives under controllable and uncontrollable threats (1987) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 52 (3), pp. 639-644; Keller, J.W., Yang, Y.E., Leadership style, decision context, and the poliheuristic theory of decision-making: An experimental analysis (2008) Journal of Conflict Resolution, 52 (5), pp. 687-712; Keller, J.W., Yang, Y.E., Empathy and strategic interation in crises: A poliheuristic perspective (2009) Foreign Policy Analysis, 5 (2), pp. 169-189; Kinne, B.J., Decision-making in autocratic regimes: A poliheuristic perspective (2005) International Studies Perspectives, 6 (1), pp. 114-128; Kugler, R.L., Deterrence of cyber attacks (2009), In: Kramer, F.

In most cases basic security measures will be implemented, but there is an assumption that the integrated COTS and GOTS systems are secure; despite the introduction of new development and integration into existing programs of record. Functional resilience for rapidly developed systems is rarely considered and can result in operational failure in real-world scenarios due to long recovery times following an attack or adverse effect. To compound the problem, techno-centric assessment teams approach their targets from one perspective (or technology) at a time, preventing discovery and mitigation of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an adversary who is goal-oriented, not technologycentric or prohibitive. Sandia National Laboratory's (SNL) Information Design Assurance Red team (formerly the Information Operations Red Team Assessment (IORTA)), lists eight separate red teaming methods, to include (SNL, 2007): 1. Design assurance red teaming 2. Red team hypothesis testing 3. Red team gaming (scenario play) 4. Behavioral red teaming 5. Red team benchmarking 6. Operational red teaming 7. Analytical red teaming 8. Penetration testing Each of SNL's methods are depicted as a separate action completed by multiple teams or subject matter experts. For rapid development or deployment technologies, this model of independent assessments presents three shortcomings that prevent an accurate portrait of a rapidly developed system's security posture: 1. The inability to assess for functional resilience or resonance and anticipated threats due to disparate red teams and data collection methods, and collaboration 2. Time and resource constraints on rapidly fielded technologies 3.The inability to identify vulnerabilities created through cross-domain/technology integration SNL's methodologies were developed based on traditional acquisition and development models that allow for extended testing, mitigation, and retesting. Although SNL's red teaming definitions have become widely accepted, it does not support current DoD acquisition processes for rapidly fielded systems and falls short in accurately identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities before a technology is deployed.Adaptive Red Teams (ART) research and employ adversarial techniques to exploit vulnerabilities that are overlooked by traditional assessment teams in the form of false negatives and/or false positives. ARTs employ all eight of SNL's red teaming actions simultaneously, and use any means available to acquire their intended effects, including physical, environmental, and social factors combined with other technologies or methods that can be used to disrupt, attack or otherwise compromise a given technology. To accurately vet technologies and operational processes for vulnerabilities and shortfalls, an ART will emulate an adversary by using the adversary's tools, methodologies, and tactics in an attempt to attain similar goals. This approach is an effects-based, goal-driven assessment and not a technology-centric approach to mitigating risk in experimental, rapidly developed, and deployed operational technologies and systems. This paper will briefly define a framework for adaptive red teams and introduce the processes necessary to integrate security and resiliency into development practices for rapidly developed systems and programs integrating COTS and GOTS technologies and systems.",Adaptive red team; Functional resilience; Functional resonance; Preliminary threat assessment; Security posture,Adaptive RED; Functional resilience; Functional resonance; Security posture; Threat assessment; Environmental technology; Resonance; Risk assessment; Technology; Integration testing,,,,,"Bodeau, D.J., Gaubart, R., Cyber Engineering Framework (2011), MITRE Technical Report MTR 110237.

Firewall performance, which is a key ingredient for network performance, can be greatly degraded by traffic crafted to exploit its filtering algorithms. These attacks can greatly reduce the Quality of Service (QoS) received by existing authorized flows in the firewall. This paper proposes a novel architecture that decouples this linkage between authorized flow QoS and adversarial traffic, marginalizing disruption caused by unauthorized flows, and ultimately improving overall performance of software defined firewalls. We show substantial improvements in throughput, packet loss, and latency over baseline software defined firewalls with varying ratios of attack traffic. All results are obtained using the cycle accurate architecture simulator gem5, and Internet packet traces obtained from 10 Gbps interfaces of core Internet routers. © 2013 IEEE.",,Attack traffic; Core Internet; Cycle accurate; Filtering algorithm; Internet packets; Novel architecture; Packet filtering; Ubiquitous Security; Computer architecture; Network architecture; Quality of service; Computer system firewalls,,,,,"Namestnikov, Y., Kaspersky Security Bulletin (2011) Statistics, p. 2012. , March; Gouda, M.G., Liu, X.-Y.A., Firewall Design: Consistency, Completeness, and Compactness Proceedings of International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems, 2004, pp. 320-327; Baboescu, F., Varghese, G., Fast and Scalable Conflict Detection for Packet Classifiers Proceedings of 10th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols, Nov. 2002, pp. 270-279; Hari, A., Suri, S., Parulkar, G., Detecting and Resolving Packet Filter Conflicts Proceedings of Nineteenth Annual Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies (INFOCOM 2000), Mar. 2000, 3, pp. 1203-1212. , vol.3; Eppstein, D., Muthukrishnan, S., Internet Packet Filter Management and Rectangle Geometry Proceedings of the Twelfth Annual ACMSIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA '01), Philadelphia, PA, USA, 2001, pp. 827-835. , Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics; Liu, A.X., Gouda, M.G., Firewall Policy Queries (2009) IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, 20 (6), pp. 766-777. , june; High Level Firewall Language, , https://www.hlfl.org; Begel, A., McCanne, S., Graham, S.L., BPF+: Exploiting Global Data-Flow Optimization in a Generalized Packet Filter Architecture Proceedings of the Conference on Applications, Technologies, Architectures, and Protocols for Computer Communication (SIGCOMM '99), New York, NY, USA, 1999, pp. 123-134+ACM; Bartal, Y., Mayer, A., Nissim, K., Wool, A., Firmato: A Novel Firewall Management Toolkit (2004) ACMTransactions on Computer Systems, 22 (4), pp. 381-420. , Nov; Guttman, J.D., Filtering Postures: Local Enforcement for Global Policies Proceedings of IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, May 1997, pp. 120-129; Gupta, P., McKeown, N., Algorithms for Packet Classification (2001) IEEE Network, 15 (2), pp. 24-32. , mar/apr; Tsuchiya, P.F., (1991) A Search Algorithm for Table Entries with Non- Contiguous Wildcarding; Srinivasan, V., Varghese, G., Suri, S., Waldvogel, M., Fast and Scalable Layer Four Switching (1998) SIGCOMM Comput.

The objective of the operators is to steer the vehicles to the desired formation subject to the given state and input constraints. Each operator-vehicle pair is attacked by an adversary who is able to maliciously replay the control commands sent from the operator. To play against attackers, we come up with a novel distributed resilient algorithm based on the receding-horizon control methodology, and show that the algorithm is able to allow vehicles, on the one hand, satisfy state and input constraints, and on the other hand, asymptotically achieve the desired formation despite replay attacks. With slight modifications, our proposed algorithm shows an analogous resilience to denial-of-service attacks. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In systems that utilize OFDM, synchronization between the transmitter and the receiver is paramount. However, many current acquisition algorithms and implementations are susceptible to corruption by adversarial communications systems. This paper outlines two improvements to OFDM timing and frequency offset estimation; sync-amble randomization and Cross Ambiguity Function (CAF) acquisition. Both analysis and simulation results are provided which suggest that both of these strategies offer improvements in physical layer security to OFDM synchronization in the presence of attacking communication systems, with minimal impact on overall performance. © 2013 NICT.",,4G systems; Analysis and simulation; Communications standard; Communications systems; Cross Ambiguity Function (CAF); Frequency offset estimation; Physical layer security; Physical layers; Frequency allocation; Mergers and acquisitions; Multimedia systems; Network layers; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Synchronization,,,,,"Van Nee, R., Prasad, R., (2000) OFDM for Wireless Multimedia Communications, , Boston, MA: Artech House; Schmidl, T., Cox, D., Robust frequency and timing synchronization for ofdm (1997) IEEE Transactions on Communications, 45 (12). , December; Moose, P., A technique for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing frequency offset correction (1994) IEEE Transactions on Communication, 42, pp. 2908-2914. , October; Minn, H., Bhargava, V., Letaief, K., A combined timing and frequency synchronization and channel estimation for ofdm (2004) IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), , June; Beek De J.Van, Low-complex frame synchronization in ofdm systems (1995) International Conference on Universal Personal Communications (ICUPC), pp. 982-986. , November; Nogami, H., Nagashima, T., A frequency and timing period acquisition technique for ofdm systems (1995) Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PlMRC), , September; Lapan, M., Clancy, T.C., McGwier, R.W., Jamming attacks against ofdm timing synchronization and signal acquisition (2012) IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM), , October; Lapan, M., Clancy, T.C., McGwier, R.W., Phase warping and differential scrambling attacks against ofdm frequency synchronization (2013) International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), , May; Patil, R.U.S., A symbol timing synchronization algorithm for wimax ofdm (2011) Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks (CICN), , October; Physical Channels and Modulation, , www.3gpp.org, 3GPP Technical Report 36. 211; Klenner, K.K.P., Temporal autocorrelation estimation for ofdm with application to spatial interpolation (2008) IEEE Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers, pp. 995-999. , October; Physical Layer Procedures, , www.3gpp.org, 3GPP Technical Report 36. 2l3","Electrical and Computer Engineering, United States",,,,"2013 16th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications, WPMC 2013 - Co-located with Global Wireless Summit 2013",24 June 2013 through 27 June 2013,"Atlantic City, NJ",100678,13476890,,,,English,"Int.

However, it suffers from low attacking efficiency and high resource expenditure. In this paper, we approach this attack from an adversarial view and develop a matrix-based method to model the process of the node capture attack. We establish a matrix to indicate the compromising relationship between the nodes and the paths. We propose a Matrix-based node capture attack Algorithm (MA in short), which can maximize the destructiveness while consuming the minimum resource expenditure. We conduct several experiments to show the performance of MA. Experimental results manifest that MA can reduce the attacking round, shorten the execution time, enhance the attacking efficiency and conserve the energy cost. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Attacking efficiency; Energy cost; Node capture attack; Wireless sensor networks,Computer programming; Software engineering; Wireless sensor networks; Cryptographic key; Energy cost; Matrix approach; Node capture attack; Sensor nodes,,,,,"Akyildiz, I.F., Su, W., Sankarasubramaniam, Y., Cayirci, E., Wireless sensor networks: A survey (2002) Comput Netw, 38 (4), pp. 393-422. , 10.1016/S1389-1286(01)00302-4; Perrig, A., Stankovic, J., Wagner, D., Security in wireless sensor networks (2004) Commun ACM, 47 (6), pp. 53-57. , 10.1145/990680.990707; Karlof, C., Wagner, D., Secure routing in wireless sensor networks: Attacks and countermeasures (2003) Ad Hoc Netw, 1 (2), pp. 293-315. , 10.1016/S1570-8705(03)00008-8; Tague, P., Poovendran, R., Modeling adaptive node capture attacks in multi-hop wireless networks (2007) Ad Hoc Netw, 5 (6), pp. 801-814. , 10.1016/j.adhoc.2007.01.002; Chen, X., Makki, K., Yen, K., Pissinou, N., Node compromise modeling and its applications in sensor networks (2007) 12th IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications, pp. 575-582; Chan, K., Fekri, F., Node compromise attacks and network connectivity (2007) Proc SPIE, 6578, pp. 1-12; Bonaci, T., Bushnell, L., Poovendran, R., (2010) Probabilistic Analysis of Covering and Compromise in Node Capture Attacks, , http://www.ee.washington.edu/research/nsl/papers/ techReport_tamara_NodeCap.pdf; Moore, A.P., Ellison, R.J., Linger, R.C., (2001) Attack Modeling for Information Security and Survivability, , http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA388771; Fan-Hsun, T., Li-Der, C., Han-Chieh, C., A survey of black hole attacks in wireless mobile ad hoc networks (2011) J Converg, , http://www.hcis-journal.com/content/pdf/2192-1962-1-4.pdf; Hartung, C., Balasalle, J., Han, R., (2005) Compromise in sensor networks: The need for secure systems, , http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.134. 8146&rep=rep1&type=pdf; Douceur, J., The sybil attack (2002) Peer-to-peer Systems, pp. 251-260. , 10.1007/3-540-45748-8-24; Newsome, J., Shi, E., Song, D., Perrig, The sybil attack in sensor networks: Analysis and defenses (2004) Proc of the 3rd International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, pp. 259-268. , 10.1145/984622.984660; Li, M., Koutsopoulos, I., Poovendran, R., Optimal jamming attacks and network defense policies in wireless sensor networks (2007) Proc of 26th IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications, pp. 1307-1315; Xu, W., Ma, K., Trappe, W., Zhang, Y., Jamming sensor networks: Attack and defense strategies (2006) IEEE Netw, 20 (3), pp. 41-47. , 10.1109/MNET.2006.1637931; Raymond, D., Midkiff, S., Denial-of-service in wireless sensor networks: Attacks and defenses (2008) IEEE Pervasive Comput, 7 (1), pp. 74-81. , 10.1109/MPRV.2008.6; Krontiris, I., Giannetsos, T., Dimitriou, T., Launching a sinkhole attack in wireless sensor networks; The intruder side (2008) Proc IEEE 4th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing in Networking and Communications, pp. 526-531. , 10.1109/WiMob.2008.83; Fu, H., Kawamura, S., Zhang, M., Zhang, L., Replication attack on random key pre-distribution schemes for wireless sensor networks (2008) Comput Commun, 31 (4), pp. 842-857. , 10.1016/j.comcom.2007.10.026; Manjula, V., Chellappan, C., The replication attack in wireless sensor networks: Analysis and defenses (2011) Adv Netw Commun, pp. 169-178; Ho, J.W., Wright, M., Das, S.K., Fast detection of replica node attacks in mobile sensor networks using sequential analysis (2009) Proc IEEE 28th International Conference on Computer Communications, pp. 1773-1781; Chan, H., Perrig, A., Song, D., Random key predistribution schemes for sensor networks (2003) Proc 2003 Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 197-213. , 10.1109/SECPRI.2003.1199337; Eschenauer, L., Gligor, V.D., A key-management scheme for distributed sensor networks (2002) Proc 9th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 41-47; Hong, S., Lim, S., Analysis and attack models via unified modeling language in wireless sensor networks: A survey study (2010) Proc 2010 IEEE International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Information Security (WCNIS), pp. 692-696. , 10.1109/WCINS.2010.5541868; Hong, S., Lim, S., Song, J., Unified modeling language based analysis of security attacks in wireless sensor networks: A survey (2011) KSII Trans Internet Inf Syst, 5 (5), pp. 805-821. , 10.3837/tiis.2011.04.010; Chan, K., Fekri, F., (2011) Node Compromise Attacks and Network Connectivity.

In one pertinent, well-motivated attack scenario, an adversary may attempt to evade a deployed system at test time by carefully manipulating attack samples. In this work, we present a simple but effective gradient-based approach that can be exploited to systematically assess the security of several, widely-used classification algorithms against evasion attacks. Following a recently proposed framework for security evaluation, we simulate attack scenarios that exhibit different risk levels for the classifier by increasing the attacker's knowledge of the system and her ability to manipulate attack samples. This gives the classifier designer a better picture of the classifier performance under evasion attacks, and allows him to perform a more informed model selection (or parameter setting). We evaluate our approach on the relevant security task of malware detection in PDF files, and show that such systems can be easily evaded. We also sketch some countermeasures suggested by our analysis. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.",adversarial machine learning; evasion attacks; neural networks; support vector machines,Attack scenarios; Classification algorithm; Classifier performance; Deployed systems; evasion attacks; Malware detection; Parameter setting; Security evaluation; Algorithms; Neural networks; Risk perception; Support vector machines; Learning systems,,,,,"Adobe: PDF Reference, , sixth edn. version 1.7; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., Can machine learning be secure?

In order to implement the estimator, the sensors, in addition to sensing, implement a simple data fusion protocol that relies on inter-sensor communication. In this paper, we study distributed estimation of cyber-physical systems when there is an adversarial attack on the sensed and communicated information. We propose a novel methodology to address the detection of such attacks, and further incorporate appropriate remedial actions in the estimator. Our methodology is based on the notions of local consistency and nodal consistency and is further reinforced by the exploiting the underlying physical-layer in the cyber-physical description. © 2013 IEEE.",cyber-physical systems; Distributed estimation; dynamical systems; information security,Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Cyber physicals; Distributed estimation; Fusion protocol; Local consistency; Novel methodology; Remedial actions; Data fusion; Dynamical systems; Embedded systems; Security of data; Sensor networks; Signal processing; Estimation,,,,,"Antsaklis, P., Baillieul, J., Special issue on technology of networked control systems (2007) Proceedings of the IEEE, 95 (1), pp. 5-8. , Jan; Imer, O.C., Yuksel, S., Başar, T., Optimal control of LTI systems over unreliable communication links (2006) Automatica, 42 (9), pp. 1429-1439; Schenato, L., Sinopoli, B., Franceschetti, M., Poolla, K., Sastry, S.S., Foundations of control and estimation over lossy networks (2007) Proceedings of the IEEE, 95 (1), pp. 163-187. , Jan; Sinopoli, B., Schenato, L., Franceschetti, M., Poolla, K., Jordan, M.I., Sastry, S.S., Kalman filtering with intermittent observations (2003) 42nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, 1, pp. 701-708. , Dec; Micheli, M., (2001) Random Sampling of A Continuous-time Stochastic Dynamical System: Analysis, , State Estimation, and Applications: Research Project; Plarre, K., Bullo, F., On Kalman filtering for detectable systems with intermittent observations (2009) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 54 (2), pp. 386-390. , Feb; Mo, Y., Sinopoli, B., A characterization of the critical value for Kalman filtering with intermittent observations (2008) 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, pp. 2692-2697. , Dec; Xiao, L., Boyd, S., Fast linear iterations for distributed averaging (2004) Systems and Controls Letters, 53 (1), pp. 65-78. , Apr; Olfati-Saber, R., Distributed Kalman filter with embedded consensus filters (2005) European Control Conference, pp. 8179-8184. , Dec; Carli, R., Chiuso, A., Schenato, L., Zampieri, S., Distributed Kalman filtering using consensus strategies (2007) 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, pp. 5486-5491. , Dec; Khan, U.A., Moura, J.M.F., Distributing the Kalman filter for large-scale systems (2008) IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 56 (10), pp. 4919-4935. , Oct.

Current synchronization methods, such as those developed by Schmidl and Cox [1], were not designed to be robust to adversarial signals. A series of attacks against the preamble synchronization stage have been developed and demonstrated to debilitate OFDM receivers. Multiple attacks against the frequency offset error estimation stage are discussed, and some possible improvements to OFDM synchronization algorithms are suggested. © 2013 IEEE.",Jamming; OFDM; Synchronization,Communications systems; Frequency offsets; Frequency synchronization; OFDM receiver; OFDM systems; Synchronization algorithm; Synchronization method; Timing and frequency synchronizations; Frequency allocation; Jamming; Signal processing; Synchronization; Telecommunication systems; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing,,,,,"Schmidl, T., Cox, D., Robust frequency and timing synchronization for OFDM (1997) IEEE Transactions on Communications, 45 (12). , December; La Pan, M., Clancy, T., McGwier, R., Jamming attacks against OFDM timing synchronization and signal acquisition (2012) IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM), , October; Clancy, T., Efficient OFDM denial: Pilot jamming and pilot nulling (2011) IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), , June; Pollet, T., Van Bladel, M., Moeneclaey, M., BER sensitivity of OFDM systems to carrier frequency offset and wiener phase noise (1995) IEEE Transactions on Communications (ICC) 1995, 43 (2-4). , 3, Feb/Mar/Apr; Klenner, P., Kammeyer, K., Temporal autocorrelation estimation for OFDM with application to spatial interpolation (2008) IEEE Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers, pp. 995-999. , October; Minn, H., Bhargava, V., Letaief, K., A combined timing and frequency synchronization and channel estimation for OFDM (2004) IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), , June; Moretti, M., Cosovic, I., OFDM synchronization in an uncoordinated spectrum sharing scenario (2007) IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference (GLOBECOM), , November; Patil, S., Upadhyay, R., A symbol timing synchronization algorithm for WiMAX OFDM (2011) Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks (CICN), , October; Kleider, J., Gifford, S., Maalouli, G., Chuprun, S., Sadler, B., Synchronization for RF carrier frequency hopped OFDM: Analysis and simulation (2003) IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM), , October; Nasraoui, L., Atallah, L., Siala, M., An efficient reduced-complexity two-stage differential sliding correlation approach for OFDM synchronization in the AWGN channel (2011) IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC), , September; Van Nee, R., Prasad, R., (2000) OFDM for Wireless Multimedia Communications, , Boston, MA: Artech House; Peng, D., Peng, L., Yin, C., Yue, G., The spatial diversity algorithms of carrier frequency offset synchronization for MIMO-OFDM systems (2006) Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks, 2006 IET International Conference on, , November; Li, D., Li, Y., Zhang, H., Wang, L., Cross ambiguity function based integer frequency offset estimation for OFDM systems (2012) IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference: PHY and Fundamentals","Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, United States",,IEE Signal Processing Society,,"2013 38th IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, ICASSP 2013",26 May 2013 through 31 May 2013,"Vancouver, BC",101421,15206149,9.78148E+12,IPROD,,English,ICASSP IEEE Int Conf Acoust Speech Signal Process Proc,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890514407,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The variety of database queries and enforcement mechanisms has recently sparked the development of a number of mechanized proof techniques for differential privacy. Personal data, however, are often spread across multiple databases and queries have to be jointly computed by multiple, possibly malicious, parties. Many cryptographic protocols have been proposed to protect the data in transit on the network and to achieve differential privacy in a distributed, adversarial setting. Proving differential privacy for such protocols is hard and, unfortunately, out of the scope of the aforementioned mechanized proof techniques. In this work, we present the first framework for the mechanized verification of distributed differential privacy. We propose a symbolic definition of differential privacy for distributed databases, which takes into account Dolev-Yao intruders and can be used to reason about compromised parties. Furthermore, we develop a linear, distance-aware type system to statically and automatically enforce distributed differential privacy in cryptographic protocol implementations (expressed in the RCF calculus). We also provide an algorithmic variant of our type system, which we prove sound and complete. Finally, we tested our analysis technique on a recently proposed protocol for privacy-preserving web analytics: we discovered a new attack acknowledged by the authors, proposed a fix, and successfully type-checked the revised variant. © 2013 Authors, as per new IEEE copyright agreement.",cryptographic protocols; differential privacy; type systems,Algorithmic variants; Cryptographic protocols; Differential privacies; Distributed database; Enforcement mechanisms; Mechanized verifications; Statistical information; Type systems; Cryptography; Database systems; Differentiation (calculus); Internet protocols; Security systems; Data privacy,,,,,"Narayanan, A., Shmatikov, V., Robust de-anonymization of large sparse datasets (2008) SP'08.

Among them, the notion of key privacy in public-key encryption, which guarantees that an adversary is unable to tell with which public key a certain ciphertext has been produced, plays a key-role in the design of several anonymous protocols. Apparently, it seems to be unrelated to the security of the encrypted content, and it looks like just an additional property the encryption scheme can enjoy. In this paper we show that for a robust encryption scheme key privacy under chosen ciphertext attack implies non-malleability and, hence, security under chosen ciphertext attacks. Then, we look at two privacy-preserving protocols: secret sets and anonymous broadcast encryption. We prove that secret sets and anonymous broadcast are equivalent w.r.t. non-adaptive adversaries: the first can be used to design the second and vice versa. Finally, we revisit some previous constructions for secret sets, and we show the security properties they enjoy within a rigorously defined adversarial model. © 2013 IEEE.",,Anonymous broadcast; Anonymous protocol; Chosen ciphertext attack; Encryption schemes; Privacy preserving; Privacy-preserving protocols; Public-key encryption; Security properties; Public key cryptography,,,,,"Abdalla, M., Bellare, M., Neven, G., Robust encryption (2010) Proc. of TCC 2010, LNCS, 5978, pp. 480-497; Bellare, M., Boldyreva, A., Desai, A., Pointcheval, D., Key-privacy in public-key encryption (2001) Proc. of Asiacrypt 2001, LNCS, 2248, pp. 566-582; Bellare, M., Desai, A., Pointcheval, D., Rogaway, P., Relations among notions of security for public-key encryption schemes (1998) Proc. of Crypto 1998, LNCS, 1462, pp. 26-45; Barth, A., Boneh, D., Waters, B., Privacy in encrypted content distribution using private broadcast encryption (2006) Proc. of Financial Cryptography (FC 2006), LNCS, 4107, pp. 52-64; Catalano, D., Dodis, Y., Visconti, I., Mercurial commitments: Minimal assumptions and efficient constructions (2006) Proc. of the Third Theory of Cryptography Conference (TCC 06), LNCS, 3876, pp. 120-144; Catalano, D., Fiore, D., Messina, M., Zero-knowledge sets with short proofs (2008) Proc. of Eurocrypt 2008, LNCS, 4965, pp. 433-450; Chase, M., Healy, A., Lysyanskaya, A., Malkin, T., Rezin, L., Mercurial Committments with applications to zero-knowkedge sets (2005) Proc. of Eurocrypt 2005, LNCS, 3494, pp. 422-439; Dolev, D., Dwork, C., Naor, M., Non-malleable cryptography (2000) SIAM Journal of Computing, 30 (2), pp. 391-437; De Santis, A., Masucci, B., On secret set schemes (2000) Inform.

Our contribution in this paper is fourfold: (1) we model the interaction between RRM defender and DoS attacker as a game in order to determine the parameters by which the defender can maximize her benefit, (2) we model route selection as a constraint satisfaction optimization and formalize it using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) to identify efficient practical routes, (3) we provide algorithms for sound and smooth deployment of RRM on conventional as well as software-defined networks, and (4) we develop analytical and experimental models to investigate the effectiveness and limitation of RRM under different network and adversarial parameters. Our analysis and preliminary implementation show that RRM can protect up to 90% of flow packets from being attacked against persistent attackers, as compared with single-path routing schemes. Moreover, our implementation shows that RRM can be efficiently deployed on networks without causing any disruption for flows. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.",,Constraint Satisfaction; Denial of service attacks; Experimental models; Multi path routing; Optimal strategies; Satisfiability modulo Theories; Single-path routing; Software-defined networks; Optimization; Quality of service; Security of data; Security systems; Computer crime,,,,,"Lee, S.-J., Gerla, M., Split multipath routing with maximally disjoint paths in ad hoc networks (2001) IEEE International Conference on Communications, ICC 2001, 10, pp. 3201-3205; Andersen, D., Balakrishnan, H., Kaashoek, F., Morris, R., Resilient overlay networks (2001) Proceedings of the Eighteenth ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, SOSP 2001, pp. 131-145. , ACM, New York; Johnson, D.B., Maltz, D.A., Broch, J., DSR: The dynamic source routing protocol for multihop wireless ad hoc networks (2001) Ad Hoc Networking, pp. 139-172. , Addison-Wesley, Boston; Keromytis, A.D., Misra, V., Rubenstein, D., SOS: An architecture for mitigating ddos attacks (2004) IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 22 (1), pp. 176-188; Lantz, B., Heller, B., McKeown, N., A network in a laptop: Rapid prototyping for software-defined networks (2010) Proceedings of the Ninth ACM SIGCOMM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks, Hotnets 2010, pp. 19:1-19:6. , ACM, New York; Lee, P., Misra, V., Rubenstein, D., Distributed algorithms for secure multipath routing in attack-resistant networks (2007) IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, 15 (6), pp. 1490-1501; Lou, W., Liu, W., Fang, Y., SPREAD: Enhancing data confidentiality in mobile ad hoc networks (2004) IEEE INFOCOM, pp. 2404-2413; Marina, M., Das, S., On-demand multipath distance vector routing in ad hoc networks (2001) Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols, ICNP, pp. 14-23; Mavropodi, R., Kotzanikolaou, P., Douligeris, C., SecMR - A secure multipath routing protocol for ad hoc networks (2007) Ad Hoc Networks, 5 (1), pp. 87-99; (2013) POX Wiki, , https://openflow.stanford.edu/display/ONL/POX+Wiki, OpenFlow group at; McKeown, N., Anderson, T., Balakrishnan, H., Parulkar, G., Peterson, L., Rexford, J., Shenker, S., Turner, J., Openflow: Enabling innovation in campus networks (2008) ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review, 38 (2), pp. 69-74; (2012) Z3: An Efficient Theorem Prover, , http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/z3/; Papadimitratos, P., Haas, Z.J., Secure routing for mobile ad hoc networks (2002) SCS Communication Networks and Distributed Systems Modeling and Simulation Conference, San Antonio, TX, USA, pp. 193-204; Robert, C.P., Casella, G., (1999) Monte Carlo Statistical Methods, , 1st edn.

Many localization approaches have been proposed based on anchor nodes, which are assumed to know their locations by manual placement or additional equipments such as global positioning system. However, none of these approaches can work properly under the adversarial scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme called two-step secure localization (TSSL) stand against many typical malicious attacks, e.g. wormhole attack and location spoofing attack. TSSL detects malicious nodes step by step. First, anchor nodes collaborate with each other to identify suspicious nodes by checking their coordinates, identities and time of sending information. Then, by using a modified mesh generation scheme, malicious nodes are isolated and the WSN is divided into areas with different trust grades. Finally, a novel localization algorithm based on the arrival time difference of localization information is adopted to calculate locations of unknown nodes. Simulation results show that the TSSL detects malicious nodes effectively and the localization algorithm accomplishes localization with high localization accuracy. © 2012 The Author.

This approach models illegitimate users as ones who randomly access records. The goal is to use statistics, machine learning, knowledge of workflows and other techniques to support an anomaly detection framework that finds such users. In this paper we introduce and study a random topic access model or RTA aimed at users whose access may be illegitimate but is not fully random because it is focused on common semantic themes. We argue that this model is appropriate for a meaningful range of attacks and develop a system based on topic summarization that is able to formalize the model and provide anomalous user detection effectively for it. To this end, we use healthcare as an example and propose a framework for evaluating the ability to recognize various types of random users called random topic access detection or RTAD. Specifically, we utilize a combination of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), for feature extraction, a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm for outlier detection and evaluate the ability to identify different adversarial types. We validate the technique in the context of hospital audit logs where we show varying degrees of success based on user roles and the anticipated characteristics of attackers. In particular, it was found that RTAD exhibits strong performance for roles are described by a few topics, but weaker performance when users are more topic-agnostic. © 2013 IEEE.",Access Logs; Anomaly Detection; Data Mining; Electronic Health Records; Healthcare Security; Insider threats,Access log; Anomaly detection; Anomaly detection frameworks; Developing strategy; Electronic health record; Insider Threat; K Nearest Neighbor (k NN) algorithm; Latent dirichlet allocations; Data mining; Feature extraction; Health care; Semantics; Statistics; Information science,,,,,"Chen, Y., Malin, B., Detecting anomalous insiders in collaborative information systems (2012) IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, 9 (3), pp. 332-344. , May; Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I., Latent dirichlet allocation (2003) J.

As such, they are naturally appealing for cryptographic applications, and have caught the interest of both theoreticians and practitioners. A major step towards understanding and securely using PUFs was recently taken in [Crypto 2011] where Brzuska, Fischlin, Schröder and Katzenbeisser model PUFs in the Universal Composition (UC) framework of Canetti [FOCS 2001]. A salient feature of their model is that it considers trusted PUFs only; that is, PUFs which have been produced via the prescribed manufacturing process and are guaranteed to be free of any adversarial influence. However, this does not accurately reflect real-life scenarios, where an adversary could be able to create and use malicious PUFs. The goal of this work is to extend the model proposed in [Crypto 2011] in order to capture such a real-world attack. The main contribution of this work is the study of the Malicious PUFs model. To this end, we first formalize the notion of ""malicious"" PUFs, and extend the UC formulation of Brzuska et al. to allow the adversary to create PUFs with arbitrary adversarial behaviour. Then, we provide positive results in this, more realistic, model. We show that, under computational assumptions, it is possible to UC-securely realize any functionality. © 2013 International Association for Cryptologic Research.",,Computational assumptions; Cryptographic applications; Manufacturing process; Real-world attack; Salient features; Secure computation; Universally composable; Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Cryptography,,,,,"Agrawal, S., Goyal, V., Jain, A., Prabhakaran, M., Sahai, A., New impossibility results for concurrent composition and a non-interactive completeness theorem for secure computation (2012) LNCS, 7417, pp. 443-460. , Safavi-Naini, R.

DKs enable detection of complete compromise by an attacker of the device and its secret state, e.g., cryptographic keys. A DK evolves within a device randomly over time. Thus an attacker will create DKs that randomly diverge from those in the original, valid device over time, alerting a trusted verifier to the attack. DKs may be transmitted unidirectionally from a device, eliminating interaction between the device and verifier. Device emissions of DK values can be quite compact - even just a single bit - and DK evolution and emission require minimal computation. Thus DKs are well suited for highly constrained devices, such as sensors and hardware authentication tokens. We offer a formal adversarial model for DKs, and present a simple scheme that we prove essentially optimal (undominated) for a natural class of attack timelines. We explore application of this scheme to one-time passcode authentication tokens. Using the logs of a large enterprise, we experimentally study the effectiveness of DKs in detecting the compromise of such tokens. © 2013 IEEE.",,Authentication token; Constrained devices; Cryptographic key; Detecting devices; Large enterprise; New approaches; Simple schemes; Single-bit; Authentication,,,,,"Amariucai, G.T., Bergman, C., Guan, Y., An automatic, time-based, secure pairing protocol for passive RFID (2011) RFIDSec, pp. 108-126; Anderson, R., Kuhn, M., Tamper resistance-A cautionary note (1996) USENIX Security, pp. 1-11; Bowers, K.D., Juels, A., Rivest, R.L., Shen, E., (2013) Drifting Keys: Impersonation Detection for Constrained Devices, , http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=4016; Conti, M., Di Pietro, R., Mancini, L.V., Mei, A., Distributed detection of clone attacks in wireless sensor networks (2011) IEEE Trans.

Each observer is insensitive to one fault/attack mode and sensitive to other modes. The design of the observers is achieved by using a delay-dependent linear matrix inequality method. The performance of our model-based diagnostic scheme is tested on a class of adversarial scenarios based on a generalized fault/attack model. This model represents both classical sensor-actuator faults and communication network-induced deception attacks. Our particular focus is on stealthy deception attacks in which the attacker's goal is to pilfer water through canal offtakes. Our analysis reveals the benefits of accurate hydrodynamic models in detecting physical faults and cyber attacks to automated canal systems. We also comment on the criticality of sensor measurements for the purpose of detection. Finally, we discuss the knowledge and effort required for a successful deception attack. © 2012 IEEE.",Delay systems; Fault diagnosis; Intrusion detection; Supervisory control; Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems,Delay systems; Hydrodynamic model; Linear matrix inequality method; Model-based diagnostics; Sensor measurements; Supervisory control; Supervisory control and dataacquisition systems (SCADA); Water distribution networks; Control; Failure analysis; Hydraulic structures; Hydrodynamics; Intrusion detection; Linear matrix inequalities; Models; Sensors; Water distribution systems; SCADA systems,,,,,"Litrico, X., Malaterre, P.-O., Baume, J.-P., Vion, P.-I., Ribot-Bruno, J., Automatic tuning of PI controllers for an irrigation canal pool (2007) Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering, 133 (1), pp. 27-37. , DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9437(2007)133:1(27); Rijo, M., Arranja, C., Supervision and water depth automatic control of an irrigation canal (2010) J.

The French system remains, despite shifts towards adversarial elements and recurring attacks on the pivotal role of the eponymous Juge d'instruction, one of Europe's inquisitorial judicial systems, and its structure of judicial supervision of police enquiries and epistemological ethos of truth seeking has periodically been advocated to improve the probity of cases in countries like England with adversarial systems pitting partisan cases supported by discrete pieces of evidence. This article explores how the supervisory system works in practice, the methods and thought processes of the French investigators in all their forms, and the societal ethos within which they operate. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",detective culture; France; homicide investigation; inquisitorial system; policing,,,,,,"Atkinson, J., (1978) Discovering suicide; studies in the social organization of sudden death, , London,: Macmillan; Balland, P., (2003) Les Policiers, , Paris,: Seli Arslan; Bell, J., (2001) French legal cultures, , London,: Butterworth; Dawent, R.-P., Huercano-Hidalgo, G., (2005) Contre-enquête à Outreau: Sexe, mensonges et vérité, , Brussels,: Luc Pire; Diaz, C., Fontanaud, D., Desfarges, M., (1994) Le Livre du crime, , Paris,: Calmann-Lévy; http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/crime/data/database, Eurostat, Available from: [Accessed 25 August 2012]; Greilsamer, L., Schneidermann, D., (2002) Où vont les juges?, , What next for French examining magistrates?, Paris,: Fayard; Hodgson, J., (2000) Contrasting criminal justice, pp. 139-156. , In: Nelken D., editors Aldershot,: Ashgate; Hodgson, J., The police the prosecutor and the juge d'instruction: judicial supervision in France, theory and practice (2001) British Journal of Criminology, 41 (2), pp. 342-361; Hodgson, J., (2005) French criminal justice: A comparative account of the investigation and prosecution of crime in France, , Oxford,: Hart; Hodgson, J., The French prosecutor in question (2010) Washington and Lee Law Review, 67 (4), pp. 1361-1411; Hodgson, J., Safeguarding suspects' rights in EU criminal justice: a comparative perspective (2011) New Criminal Law Review, 14 (4), pp. 611-665; Hodgson, J., (2012) The prosecutor in transnational perspective, pp. 116-134. , In: Luna E., Wade M., editors Oxford,: Oxford University Press; Holdaway, S., Parker, S.K., Policing women police: uniform patrol, promotion and representation in the CID (1998) British Journal of Criminology, 38 (1), pp. 40-60; Jouve, P., (2004) Brigade Criminelle: L'enquête inédite, , Paris,: Editions Denoël; Leigh, L.H., Zedner, L., (1992) A report on the administration of criminal justice in the pre-trial phases in France and Germany, , London,: HMSO, Royal Commission on Criminal Justice; Le Taillanter, R., (2001) 36 Quai des Orfèvres: Le dossier, , Paris,: Grancher; Levy, R., (1987) Du suspect au coupable: Le travail de police judiciaire, , Geneva,: Meridiens Klincksieck; McKillop, B., (1997) Anatomy of a French murder case, , Leichhardt, NSW,: Hawkins Press, Institute of Criminology Monograph Series; Mucchielli, L., (2002) Crime et sécurité: L'état des savoirs, pp. 148-157. , In: Mucchielli L., Robert P., editors Paris,: La Découverte; Mucchielli, L., Recherche sur les homicides: auteurs et victimes (2002) Penal Issues, 2002 (1), pp. 1-4; Mouhanna, C., (2001) Polices judicaires et magistrats: Une affaire de confiance, , Paris,: La documentation française; Osterburg, J., Ward, R., (1997) Criminal investigation: A method for reconstructing the past, , Ohio,: Anderson Publishing Company; Saleem, F., Homicide in a diverse world; SIO conference editorial 2010 (2011) The Journal of Homicide and Major Incident Investigation, 7 (1), pp. 5-17; Sesmat, E., (2006) Les deux affaires Grégory, , Paris,: Belfond; van den Haag, E., Limiting plea bargaining and prosecutorial discretion (1984) Cumberland Law Review, 15, p. 1; Van Geirt, J.P., (1995) La Crim' Les grandes affaires de la Brigade Criminelle, , Paris,: Edition 1; Wilson, J.Q., (1978) The investigators: Managing FBI and narcotics agents, , New York, NY,: Basic Books; Zauberman, R., Le traitement des vols et cambriolages par la gendarmerie nationale en France (1997) Déviance et Société, 21 (4), pp. 323-363","Harris, C.; Department of Sociology, , London, United Kingdom; 电子邮件: charlotte.harris@britsoccrim.org",,,,,,,,10439463,,,,English,Policing Soc.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882686830,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these works, so-called ""Strong PUFs"" are regarded as a new, fundamental cryptographic primitive of their own, comparable to the bounded storage model, quantum cryptography, or noisebased cryptography. This paper continues this line of research, investigating the correct adversarial attack model and the actual security of such protocols. In its first part, we define and compare different attack models. They reach from a clean, first setting termed the ""stand-alone, good PUF model"" to stronger scenarios like the ""bad PUF model"" and the ""PUF re-use model"". We argue why these attack models are realistic, and that existing protocols would be faced with them if used in practice. In the second part, we execute exemplary security analyses of existing schemes in the new attack models. The evaluated protocols include recent schemes from Brzuska et al. published at Crypto 2011 [1] and from Ostrovsky et al. [18]. While a number of protocols are certainly secure in their own, original attack models, the security of none of the considered protocols for OT, BC, or KE is maintained in all of the new, realistic scenarios. One consequence of our work is that the design of advanced cryptographic PUF protocols needs to be strongly reconsidered. Furthermore, it suggests that Strong PUFs require additional hardware properties in order to be broadly usable in such protocols: Firstly, they should ideally be ""erasable"", meaning that single PUF-responses can be erased without affecting other responses. If the area efficient implementation of this feature turns out to be difficult, new forms of Controlled PUFs [8] (such as Logically Erasable and Logically Reconfigurable PUFs [13]) may suffice in certain applications. Secondly, PUFs should be ""certifiable"", meaning that one can verify that the PUF has been produced faithfully and has not been manipulated in any way afterwards. The combined implementation of these features represents a pressing and challenging problem, which we pose to the PUF hardware community in this work. © 2013 IEEE.",(Strong) Physical Unclonable Functions; (Strong) PUFs; Attack Models; Bit Commitment; Certifiable PUFs; Erasable PUFs; Key Exchange; Oblivious Transfer,(Strong) PUFs; Attack model; Bit commitment; Certifiable PUFs; Erasable PUFs; Key exchange; Oblivious transfer; Physical unclonable functions; Computer hardware; Design; Hardware; Quantum cryptography; Network security,,,,,"Brzuska, C., Fischlin, M., Schröder, H., Katzenbeisser, S., Physical Unclonable Functions in the Universal Composition Framework (2011) CRYPTO; Brzuska, C., Fischlin, M., Schröder, H., Katzenbeisser, S., Physical Unclonable Functions in the Universal Composition Framework (2011) Cryptology ePrint Archive, , Full version of the paper.

Given the presence of enemy components and the possibility of malicious cyber attacks compromising the security of networked teams, a position agreement must be reached by the networked mobile team based on environmental changes. The problem is addressed under a distributed decision making framework that is robust to possible cyber attacks, which has an advantage over centralized decision making in the sense that a decision maker is not required to access information from all the other decision makers. The proposed framework derives three tuning laws for every agent; one associated with the cost, one associated with the controller, and one with the adversarial input. © 2013 SPIE.",Approximation; Consensus; Game theory; Hamilton-jacobi equations; Optimization; Security,Adversarial environments; Approximation; Centralized decision making; Consensus; Distributed decision making; Environmental change; Hamilton Jacobi equations; Security; Crime; Game theory; Multi agent systems; Optimization; Unmanned vehicles; Decision making,,,,,"Shoham, Y., Leyton-Brown, K., (2009) Multiagent Systems: Algorithmic, Gametheoretic, and Logical Foundations, , Cambridge University Press; Vamvoudakis, K.G., Lewis, F.L., Hudas, G.R., Multi-Agent differential graphical games: Online adaptive learning solution for synchronization with optimality (2012) Automatica, 48 (8), pp. 1598-1611; Cardenas, A., Amin, S., Sinopoli, B., Giani, A., Perrig, A., Sastry, S., Challenges for securing cyber physical systems (2009) Workshop on Future Directions in Cyberphysical Systems Security; Cardenas, A., Amin, S., Sastry, S., Secure control: Towards survivable cyber-physical systems (2008) First International Workshop on Cyber-Physical Systems (WCPS2008), p. 495500. , Beijing, China; Pasqualetti, F., Bicchi, A., Bullo, F., Consensus computation in unreliable networks: A system theoretic approach (2012) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 57 (1), pp. 90-104; Olfati-Saber, R., Fax, J., Murray, R., Consensus and cooperation in networked multi-agent systems (2007) Proceedings of the IEEE, 95 (1), pp. 215-233; Alpcan, T., Basar, T., (2010) Network Security: A Decision and Game Theoretic Approach, , Cambridge University Press; Basar, T., Olsder, G.J., (1999) Dynamic Noncooperative Game Theory, , (2nd ed.), Philadelphia, PA: SIAM; Van Der Schaft, A.J., L2-gain analysis of nonlinear systems and nonlinear state feedback H-1 control (1992) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 37 (6), pp. 770-784; Lewis, F.L., Syrmos, V.L., (1995) Optimal Control, , John Wiley; Kearns, M., Littman, M., Singh, S., Graphical models for game theory (2001) Proc. 17th Annual Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, pp. 253-260; Adams, R., Fournier, J., (2003) Sobolev Spaces, , New York: Academic Press; Ioannou, P.A., Fidan, B., (2006) Adaptive Control Tutorial, Advances in Design and Control, SIAM (PA); Krstic, M., Kanellakopoulos, I., Kokotovic, P.V., (1995) Nonlinear and Adaptive Control Design, , John Wiley and Sons; Pomet, J.B., Praly, L., Adaptive nonlinear regulation: Estimation from lyapunov equation (1992) IEEE Trans. on Autom.

The actions of each UAV not only get benefit from attacking targets but also reduce the risk in the environment for other UAVs. The implications of the survival probabilities and the time discount factor in this model are analyzed and the results will help to build the optimal attack strategy. An improved genetic algorithm is applied to quickly build the optimal strategy. Simulation results show that this algorithm provides better solutions than genetic algorithm. © 2013 Copyright TSI® Press.,Adversarial Environment; Attacking Strategy; Cooperative Attack; Genetic Algorithm; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,,,,,,"Ahuja, R.K., Kumar, A., Jha, K.C., Orlin, J.B., (2003) Exact and heuristic algorithms for the weapon-target assignment problem, , Submitted to Operations Research; Hosein, P., Athans, M., The dynamic weapon target assignment problem (1989) Proceedings of symposium on C2 research, , Washington, DC, Washington, DC; Hossein, P., Athans, M., An asymptotic result for the multi-stage weapon-target allocation problem (1990) Proceeding of IEEE conference on decision and control; Huai, L., Jian-Xin, H., Chun-mei, F., Optimal scheduling algorithm for real-time tasks in digital control systems based on GA (2008) Control and Decision Conference; Murphey, R.A., Target-based weapon target assignment problems in nonlinear assignment problems: Algorithms and applications (2000), Berlin, Berlin,: Kluwer Academic Publishers; Shoumeng, Y., Xingshe, Z., Lingmin, W., GA-based automated task assignment on network processors (2005) Proceedings of the 11th international conference on parallel and distributed systems; Wei, L., Wei, Z., Method of tasks allocation of multi-UAVs based on particles swarm optimization (2010) Control and Decision, 25 (9), pp. 1359-1363; Zhang, T., Fan, W., Li, Y., (2009) The comparative research of solving multi-task scheduling problems with GA and PSO, , Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation","Yao, M.; College of Automation Engineering, 29 Yudao St., Nanjing, 210016, China; 电子邮件: ym_nuaa@163.com",,,,,,,,10798587,,,,English,Intell.

Their objective is to protect against attempts to violate defense mechanisms. Indeed, IDSs themselves are part of the computing infrastructure, and thus they may be attacked by the same adversaries they are designed to detect. This is a relevant aspect, especially in safety-critical environments, such as hospitals, aircrafts, nuclear power plants, etc. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first work to present an overview on adversarial attacks against IDSs. In particular, this paper will provide the following original contributions: (a) a general taxonomy of attack tactics against IDSs; (b) an extensive description of how such attacks can be implemented by exploiting IDS weaknesses at different abstraction levels; (c) for each attack implementation, a critical investigation of proposed solutions and open points. Finally, this paper will highlight the most promising research directions for the design of adversary-aware, harder-to-defeat IDS solutions. To this end, we leverage on our research experience in the field of intrusion detection, as well as on a thorough investigation of the relevant related works published so far. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We extend an existing platform, Turret, designed for general distributed systems, to address the specifics of wireless routing protocols. Specifically, we add functionality to differentiate routing messages from data messages and support wireless specific attacks such as blackhole and wormhole, or routing attacks such as replay attacks. The extended platform, Turret-W, uses a network emulator to create reproducible network conditions and virtualization to run unmodified binaries of wireless protocol implementations. Using the platform on publicly available implementations of two representative routing protocols we (re-)discovered 14 attacks and 3 bugs.

An adversary capturing a few stations can corrupt most of classic protocols (e.g. leader election procedures) in most of considered models. Moreover, such attack is in practice undetectable in many realistic scenarios. In this paper we present an efficient countermeasure against Sybil attack. It is based on Proofs-of- Work technique - one of the methods of preventing sending spam. In contrast to previous solutions it is based only on limited computational power of the adversarial devices. Our approach does not require any restrictions on communication between adversarial stations.

Pebble-Rotating Game (PRG) mixes the nodes of the honest and the adversarial randomly, and can resist the Sybil attack efficiently. However, the adversary may have some tricks to corrupt the rule of PRG. This paper proposes a set of mechanisms to make the rule of PRG be obliged to obey. A new joining node must ask the Certificate Authority (CA) for its signature and certificate, which records the complete process on how a node joins the network and obtains the legitimacy of the node. Then, to prevent the adversary from accumulating identifiers, any node can make use of the latest certificate to judge whether one identifier is expired with the help of the replacement property of RPG. This paper analyzes in details the number of expired certificates which are needed to store in every node, and gives asymptotic solution of this problem. The analysis and simulations show that the mean number of the certificates stored in each node are O(log2 n), where n is the size of the network. © 2013 Ren et al.",,"algorithm; article; computer security; distributed hash table; game; information processing; information system; pebble rotating game; statistical analysis; statistical model; Algorithms; Models, Theoretical",,,,,"Stoica, I., Morris, R., Liben-Nowell, D., Karger, D., Kaashoek, M., Chord: a scalable peerto-peer lookup protocol for internet applications (2003) Networking, IEEE/ACM Transactions on, 11, pp. 17-32; Rowstron, A., Druschel, P., Pastry: Scalable, decentralized object location, and routing for large-scale peer-to-peer systems (2001) Middleware 2001, pp. 329-350. , In: Guerraoui R, editor.

The efficiency of multimedia content transmission depends on the variety of communication protocols that are simultaneously running (composed) over different network hosts in order to resolve packet conflicts. A very natural question that arises in such common settings of multimedia networks concerns the degradation (or not) of network stability under adversarial attacks that change dynamically network link capacities/slowdowns. A packet-switched network is stable if the number of packets in the network remains bounded at all times against any adversary. In this work, we embark on a systematic study of this question adopting an enhanced adversarial framework, where an adversary controls the rates of packet injections, determines packet paths and manipulates link slowdowns or capacities. Such adversarial attacks can be considered as a type of denial of service attack. Within this framework, we study network stability under specific compositions of contention-resolution protocols when packets are injected with simple paths (paths can contain repeated edges, but not repeated nodes) trying to characterise this property in terms of network topologies. The examined network topologies have been proved forbidden for stability when network link capacities/slowdowns are fixed and packet paths are simple. Furthermore, in order to evaluate how unstable can a network be for the same protocol compositions under dynamic adversarial attacks, we present an involved adversarial construction that leads a specific network to instability for arbitrarily low injection rates. Interestingly, our results suggest that dynamic adversarial attacks changing link slowdowns may be worse than dynamic adversarial attacks changing link capacities or attacks with fixed slowdowns/capacities for specific protocol compositions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Dynamic adversarial attacks; Heterogeneous multimedia networks; Reliability; Security; Stability,Content transmission; Denial of service attacks; Multimedia communication networks; Multimedia contents; Multimedia networks; Network stability; Protocol composition; Security; Convergence of numerical methods; Electric network topology; Multimedia systems; Reliability; Stability,,,,,"Levine, D., Kessler, G., Denial of service attacks (2002) Computer Security Handbook, , John Wiley & Sons, (Chapter 11); Borodin, A., Kleinberg, J., Raghavan, P., Sudan, M., Williamson, D., Adversarial queueing theory (2001) Journal of the ACM, 48 (1), pp. 13-38; Borodin, A., Ostrovsky, R., Rabani, Y., Stability preserving transformations: packet routing networks with edge capacities and speeds (2001) Proceedings of the 12th Annual ACM-SIAM Symp. on Discrete Algorithms, pp. 601-610; Moore, D., Shannon, C., Brown, D.J., Voelker, G.M., Savage, S., Inferring internet denial-of-service activity (2006) ACM Transaction on Computer System, 24 (2), pp. 115-139; Yau, D.K.Y., Lui, J.C.S., Liang, F., Yam, Y., Defending against distributed denial-of-service attacks with max-min fair server-centric router throttles (2005) IEEE/ACM Transaction on Networking, 13 (1), pp. 29-42; Floyd, S., Paxson, V., Difficulties in simulating the internet (2001) IEEE/ACM Transaction on Networking, pp. 392-403; Lynch, N., (1996) Distributed Algorithms, , Morgan Kaufmann; Chu, Y., Feigenbaum, J., LaMacchia, B., Resnick, P., Strauss, M., REFEREE: trust management for web applications (1997) Computer Networks and ISDN Systems, 29, pp. 953-964; Li, N., Mitchell, J.C., RT: a role-based trust-management framework (2003) Proceedings of the 3rd DARPA Information Survivability Conference and Exposition, pp. 201-212; Yahalom, R., Klein, B., Beth, T., Beth, D.T., Trust relationships in secure systems-A distributed authentication perspective (1993) Proceedings of IEEE Symposium on Research in Security and Privacy, pp. 150-164; Jøsang, A., Knapskog, S.J., A metric for trusted systems (1998) Proceedings of the 21st NIST-NCSC National Information Systems Security Conference, pp. 16-29; Lu, M.-T., Wu, J.-C., Peng, K.-J., Huang, P., Yao, J.J., Chen, H.H., Design and evaluation of a P2P IPTV system for heterogeneous networks (2007) IEEE Transaction on Multimedia, 9 (8), pp. 1568-1579; Zhu, X., Agrawal, P., Pal Singh, J., Alpcan, T., Girod, B., Distributed rate allocation policies for multi-homed video streaming over heterogeneous access networks (2009) IEEE Transaction on Multimedia, 11 (4), pp. 752-764; Alpcan, T., Singh, J., Basar, T., Robust rate control for heterogeneous network access in multihomed environments (2009) IEEE Transaction on Mobile Computing, 8 (1), pp. 41-51; Chen, W., Yu, J., Pan, F., Optimal priority-based call admission control scheme for qos provisioning in heterogeneous wireless networks (2011) Journal of Networks, 6 (2), pp. 319-329; Du, H., Liu, J., Liang, J., Downlink scheduling for multimedia multicast/broadcast over mobile wimax: connection-oriented multistate adaptation (2009) IEEE Wireless Communications, pp. 72-79; Shuminoski, T., Janevski, T., Cross-layer adaptive QoS provisioning for next generation wireless networks (2011) International Journal of Research and Reviews in Next Generation Networks, 1 (1), pp. 7-13; Zhao, X., Dong, Y., Zhao, H.-T., Hui, Z., Li, J., Sheng, C., A real-time congestion control mechanism for multimedia transmission over 3G wireless networks (2010) Proceedings of the 12th IEEE Int'l Conf. on Communication Technology, pp. 1236-1239; Koukopoulos, D., Mavronicolas, M., Spirakis, P., The increase of the instability of networks due to quasi-static link capacities (2007) Theoretical Computer Science, 381, pp. 44-56; Koukopoulos, D., The impact of dynamic link slowdowns on network stability (2005) Proceedings of the 8th Int'l Symp. on Parallel Architectures, Algorithms and Networks, pp. 340-345; Koukopoulos, D., The impact of dynamic adversarial attacks on the stability of heterogeneous multimedia networks (2010) Journal of Computer Communications, 33, pp. 1695-1706; Andrews, M., Awerbuch, B., Fernandez, A., Kleinberg, J., Leighton, T., Liu, Z., Universal stability results for greedy contention-resolution protocols (2001) Journal of the ACM, 48 (1), pp. 39-69; Alvarez, C., Blesa, M., Serna, M., A characterization of universal stability in the adversarial queuing model (2004) SIAM Journal on Computing, 34 (1), pp. 41-66; Tsaparas, P., Stability in adversarial queueing theory (1997), M.Sc. thesis, C.S.

In 2010, Khan and Alghathbar (KA) found out that Das's two-factor user authentication scheme for WSNs is vulnerable to the gateway node (GW-node) bypassing attack and the privileged-insider attack. They further presented an improved scheme to overcome the security flaws of Das's scheme. However, in this paper, we show that KA's scheme still suffers from the GW-node impersonation attack, the GW-node bypassing attack, and the privileged-insider attack. Hence, to fix the security flaws in KA's scheme, we propose a new user authentication scheme for WSNs. The security of the user authentication session in the proposed scheme is reduced by the model of Bellare and Rogaway. The security of partial compromise of secrets in the proposed scheme is reduced and analyzed by our adversarial model. Based on the performance evaluation, the overall cost of the proposed scheme is less than that of KA's scheme. Hence, we believe that the proposed scheme is more suitable for real security applications than KA's scheme. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.",Authentication; Gateway node bypassing attack; Gateway node impersonation attack;

Background: Cyber attacks cause major work disruption. It is important to understand how a defender's behavior (experience and tolerance to threats), as well as adversarial behavior (attack strategy), might impact the detection of threats. In this article, we use cognitive modeling to make predictions regarding these factors. Method: Different model types representing a defender, based on Instance-Based Learning Theory (IBLT), faced different adversarial behaviors. A defender's model was defined by experience of threats: threat-prone (90% threats and 10% nonthreats) and nonthreat-prone (10% threats and 90% nonthreats); and different tolerance levels to threats: risk-averse (model declares a cyber attack after perceiving one threat out of eight total) and risk-seeking (model declares a cyber attack after perceiving seven threats out of eight total). Adversarial behavior is simulated by considering different attack strategies: patient (threats occur late) and impatient (threats occur early). Results: For an impatient strategy, risk-averse models with threat-prone experiences show improved detection compared with risk-seeking models with nonthreat-prone experiences; however, the same is not true for a patient strategy. Conclusions: Based upon model predictions, a defender's prior threat experiences and his or her tolerance to threats are likely to predict detection accuracy; but considering the nature of adversarial behavior is also important. Application: Decision-support tools that consider the role of a defender's experience and tolerance to threats along with the nature of adversarial behavior are likely to improve a defender's overall threat detection.Copyright © 2012, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",adversarial behavior; cyber situation awareness; defender; experiences; Instance-Based Learning Theory; tolerance,"adversarial behavior; defender; experiences; Instance based learning; Situation awareness; Decision support systems; Fits and tolerances; Forecasting; Crime; article; awareness; computer security; computer simulation; decision making; human; learning; psychological model; risk assessment; Awareness; Computer Security; Computer Simulation; Decision Making; Humans; Learning; Models, Psychological; Risk Assessment",,,,,"Albanese, M., Jajodia, S., Pugliese, A., Subrahmanian, V.S., Scalable analysis of attack scenarios Proceedings of the 16th European Conference on Research in Computer Security; Anderson, J.R., Lebiere, C., (1998) The Atomic Components of Thought, , Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates;; Anderson, J.R., Lebiere, C., The Newell test for a theory of mind (2003) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 26 (5), pp. 587-639; Blais, A.-R., Weber, E.U., A Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) scale for adult populations (2006) Judgment and Decision Making, 1 (1), pp. 33-47; Cowan, N., The magical number 4 in short-term memory: A reconsideration of mental storage capacity (2001) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 24, pp. 87-185; Debar, H., Wespi, A., Aggregation and correlation of intrusion-detection alerts Proceedings of the 4th International Symposium on Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection; Dutt, V., Ahn, Y.S., Gonzalez, C., Cyber situation awareness: Modeling the security analyst in a cyber-attack scenario through Instance-Based Learning (2011) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 6818, pp. 280-292; Dutt, V., Cassenti, D.N., Gonzalez, C., Modeling a robotics operator manager in a tactical battlefield Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Cognitive Methods in Situation Awareness and Decision Support; Dutt, V., Gonzalez, C., Situational Awareness in Computer Network Defense: Principles, Methods and Applications, , Onwubiko C.

Thanks to their flexible logical structure, an attack can be hidden in several ways, and easily deceive protection mechanisms based on file-type filtering. Recent work showed that malicious PDF files can be accurately detected by analyzing their logical structure, with excellent results. In this paper, we present and practically demonstrate a novel evasion technique, called reverse mimicry, that can easily defeat such kind of analysis. We implement it using real samples and validate our approach by testing it against various PDF malware detectors proposed so far. Finally, we highlight the importance of developing systems robust to adversarial attacks and propose a framework to strengthen PDF malware detection against evasion. © 2013 ACM.",detection evasion; machine learning; pdf malware detection; reverse mimicry,Logical structure; Malicious pdf; Malware detection; PDF files; Protection mechanisms; Real samples; reverse mimicry; Structural methods; Computer crime; Detectors; Learning systems; Security of data,,,,,"http://contagiodump.blogspot.it; http://www.malwaretracker.com/pdfthreat.php; Metasploit Framework, , Http://www.metasploit.com/; Origami Framework, , Http://esec-lab.sogeti.com/pages/Origami; Pdf Tools, , http://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/pdf-tools/; http://pdfrate.com; Peepdf, , Http://eternal-todo.com/tools/peepdf-pdf-analysis-tool; Pypdf, , http://pybrary.net/pyPdf/; Social Engineering Toolkit, , Https://www.secmaniac.com/; Http://wepawet.iseclab.org/index.php; (2006) PDF Reference.

Unfortunately, this reliance on networks also brings new security vulnerabilities for control systems. We study the extent to which an adversary can attack a physical system by tampering with the temporal characteristics of the network, leading to time-varying delays and more importantly by changing the order in which packets are delivered. We show that such attack can destabilize a system if the controller was not designed to be robust with respect to an adversarial scheduling of messages. Although one can always store delayed messages in a buffer so as to present them to the control algorithm in the order they were sent and with a constant delay, such design is overly conservative. Instead, we design a controller that makes the best possible use of the received packets in a minimax sense. The proposed design has the same worst case performance as a controller based on a buffer but has better performance whenever there is no attack or the attacker does not play the optimal attack strategy. © 2013 ACM.",cyber-physical systems (CPS); estimation; long delays; minimax control; networked control systems (NCS); out-of-order messages; out-of-order packets; resilient control; security,Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Long delays; Mini-max controls; Out of order; Out-of-order packets; Resilient control; security; Algorithms; Controllers; Design; Embedded systems; Estimation; Networked control systems; Computer crime,,,,,"Amin, S., Cardenas, A.A., Sastry, S., Safe and secure networked control systems under denial-of-service attacks (2009) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5469, pp. 31-45. , R.

The prior works on the data authentication problem of WSN have focused on a less powerful adversarial network model or have examined a considerably more restrictive setting with specific timing or structural assumptions about WSN. We also model the ability of WSN to modify a data of n packets with a parameter: the survival rate α (0 < α≤ 1) denoting the fraction of the packets that are guaranteed to reach any particular receiver unmodified. Combining error-correcting codes with standard cryptographic primitives, our approach gives almost the same security guarantees as if each packet was individually signed, but requires only one signature operation for the entire data and adds to each transmitted packet only a small amount of authentication information. We prove the security and correctness of our scheme and analyze its performance in terms of communication overhead and computational effort at the sender and the receiver. We also compare our scheme with other typical data authentication model of WSN, and the results show that our scheme not only provides the authenticity authentication, but also has the lower overhead.

Iterative dynamics are widespread in distributed algorithms and numerical analysis. However, efficient analysis of convergence and sensitivity of iterative dynamics is quite challenging due to the lack of systematic tools. For instance, the trajectories of iterative dynamics are usually not continuous with respect to the initial condition. Hence, the classical dynamical systems theory cannot be applied directly. In this paper, a trajectory distance based Lyapunov approach is proposed as a means to tackling convergence and sensitivity to the initial condition of iterative processes. Technically the problem of convergence and sensitivity is converted into finiteness of trajectory distance and semistability analysis of discrete-time systems. A semidefinite Lyapunov function based trajectory distance approach is proposed to characterize convergence and semistability of iterative dynamics. Three examples are provided to elucidate the proposed method. Finally, the proposed framework is used to solve the convergence and stability of iterative algorithms developed for balanced resource allocation and damage mitigation problems under adversarial attacks. © 2013 The Franklin Institute.

Watson Research, United States","Security protocols operating over wireless channels can incur significant communication costs (e.g., energy, delay), especially under adversarial attacks unique to the wireless environment such as signal jamming, fake signal transmission, etc. Since wireless devices are resource constrained, it is important to optimize security protocols for wireless environments by taking into account their communication costs. Towards this goal, we first present a novel application of a signal-flow-based approach to analyze the communication costs of security protocols in the presence of adversaries. Our approach models a protocol run as a dynamic probabilistic system and then utilizes Linear System theory to evaluate the moment generating function of the end-to-end cost. Applying this technique to the problem of secret key exchange over a wireless channel, we quantify the efficiency of existing families of key exchange cryptographic protocols, showing, for example, that an ID-based approach can offer an almost 10-fold improvement in energy consumption when compared to a traditional PKI-based protocol. We then present a new key exchange protocol that combines traditional cryptographic methods with physical-layer techniques, including the use of “ephemeral” spreading codes, cooperative jamming, and role-switching. Utilizing signal flow analysis, we demonstrate that this new protocol offers performance advantages over traditional designs. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Cost; Key exchange; Linear System; Physical layer; Security protocols; Wireless,Access control; Constrained optimization; Costs; Cryptography; Energy utilization; Jamming; Linear systems; Network layers; Radio; Cryptographic methods; Cryptographic protocols; Key exchange; Key exchange protocols; Moment generating function; Physical layers; Security protocols; Wireless security protocols; Network security,,,,,"Ziemer, R.E., Peterson, R.L., Borth, D.E., Introduction to Spread Spectrum Communications (1995), Prentice Hall; Mitchell, C.J., Piper, F., Key storage in secure networks (1988) Discrete Appl.

However, in these researches, little attention has been paid to the location privacy due to the natural conflict between trust and anonymity, which is the basic protection of privacy. Although traffic safety remains the most crucial issue in VANETs, location privacy can be just as important for drivers, and neither can be ignored. In this paper, we propose a beacon-based trust management system, called BTM, that aims to thwart internal attackers from sending false messages in privacy-enhanced VANETs. To evaluate the reliability and performance of the proposed system, we conducted a set of simulations under alteration attacks, bogus message attacks, and message suppression attacks. The simulation results show that the proposed system is highly resilient to adversarial attacks, whether it is under a fixed silent period or random silent period location privacy-enhancement scheme. © 2013 JCN.",Privacy; safety; trust management; vehicle ad-hoc network (VANET),Highly resilient; Internal attacker; Location privacy; Protection of privacy; Safety of vehicles; Trust management; Trust management systems; Vehicle ad-hoc networks; Accident prevention; Ad hoc networks; Data privacy; Telecommunication networks; Management,,,,,"Raya, M., Hubaux, J.-P., Securing vehicular ad hoc networks (2007) J.

Most previous works on the topic focus on improving the statistical distribution of these delays. For example, efficient random delay generation algorithms have been proposed at CHES 2009/2010. These solutions increase security against attacks that solve the lack of synchronization between different leakage traces by integrating them. In this paper, we demonstrate that integration may not be the best tool to evaluate random delay insertions. For this purpose, we first describe different attacks exploiting pattern-recognition techniques and Hidden Markov Models. Using these tools and as a case study, we perform successful key recoveries against an implementation of the CHES 2009/2010 proposal in an Atmel microcontroller, with the same data complexity as against an unprotected implementation of the AES Rijndael. In other words, we completely cancel the countermeasure in this case. Next, we show that our cryptanalysis tools are remarkably robust to attack improved variants of the countermeasure, e.g. with additional noise or irregular dummy operations. We also exhibit that the attacks remain applicable in a non-profiled adversarial scenario. These results suggest that the use of random delays may not be effective for protecting small embedded devices against side-channel leakage. They highlight the strength of Viterbi decoding against such time-randomization countermeasures, in particular when combined with a precise description of the target implementations, using large lattices. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.",,Atmel microcontrollers; Cryptanalysis tools; Cryptographic implementation; Different attacks; Random delay insertions; Side channel attack; Software implementation; Statistical distribution; Cryptography; Embedded software; Hidden Markov models; Smart cards; Viterbi algorithm; Research,,,,,"http://point-at-infinity.org/avraes/; Brier, E., Clavier, C., Olivier, F., Correlation Power Analysis with a Leakage Model (2004) LNCS, 3156, pp. 16-29. , Joye, M., Quisquater, J.-J.

This basic approach would be sufficient in handling server failure due to natural faults, because when one server fails, data from healthy servers can be used to restore the desired redundancy level. However, in a set- ting where servers are untrusted and can behave maliciously, data redundancy must be used in tandem with Remote Data Checking (RDC) to ensure that the redundancy level of the storage systems is maintained over time. All previous RDC schemes for distributed systems impose a heavy burden on the data owner (client) during data maintenance: To repair data at a faulty server, the data owner needs to first download a large amount of data, re-generate the data to be stored at a new server, and then upload this data at a new healthy server. We propose RDC - SR, a novel RDC scheme for replication-based distributed storage systems. RDC - SR enables Server-side Repair (thus taking advantage of the premium connections available between a CSP's data centers) and places a minimal load on the data owner who only has to act as a repair coordinator. The main insight behind RDC - SR is that the replicas are differentiated based on a controllable amount of masking, which offers RDC - SR flexibility in handling different adversarial strengths. Also, replica generation must be time consuming in order to avoid certain colluding attacks from malicious servers. Our prototype for RDC - SR built on Amazon AWS validates the practicality of this new approach.

Probability distributions over the various attribute weights are then mathematically derived (using either probabilistic inversion or Bayesian density estimation). This elicitation process reduces the burden of time-consuming orientation and training in traditional methods of attribute weight elicitation, and explicitly captures the existing uncertainty and disagreement among experts, rather than attempts to achieve consensus by eliminating them. We identify the relationship between the two methods and conduct sensitivity analysis to elucidate how these methods handle expert consensus or disagreement. We also present a real-world application on elicitation of adversarial preferences over various attack scenarios to show the applicability of our proposed methods. © 2013 INFORMS.",Adversarial preference; Bayesian density estimation; Expert elicitation; Ordinal judgment; Probabilistic inversion,Adversarial preference; Density estimation; Expert elicitation; Ordinal judgment; Probabilistic inversion; Computer applications; Operations research; Probability distributions,,,,,"Abbas, A.E., Entropy method for adaptive utility elicitation (2004) IEEE Trans.

Left open in his work was the fundamental question of ""the viability of extending the coinductive approach to prove computational soundness results in the presence of active adversaries."" In this paper we make some initial steps toward this goal with respect to an extension of a trace-based security model (Micciancio and Warinschi, TCC 2004) including asymmetric and symmetric encryption; in particular we prove that a random computational trace can be soundly abstracted by a coinductive symbolic trace with overwhelming probability, provided that both the underlying encryption schemes provide IND-CCA2 security (plus ciphertext integrity for the symmetric scheme), and that the diameter of the underlying coinductively-hidden subgraph is constant in every symbolic trace. This result holds even if the protocol allows arbitrarily nested applications of symmetric/asymmetric encryption, unrestricted transmission of symmetric keys, and adversaries who adaptively corrupt users, along with other forms of active attack. As part of our proof, we formulate a game-based definition of encryption security allowing adaptive corruptions of keys and certain forms of adaptive key-dependent plaintext attack, along with other common forms of CCA2 attack. We prove that (with assumptions similar to above) security under this game is implied by IND-CCA2 security. This also characterizes a provably benign form of cyclic encryption implied by standard security definitions, which may be of independent interest. © 2013 International Association for Cryptologic Research.",active adversaries; adaptive corruptions; circular security; coinduction; Computational soundness; trace-based protocol security,Active adversary; Adaptive corruptions; circular security; Coinduction; Computational soundness; Protocol security; Artificial intelligence; Cryptography,,,,,"Abadi, M., Rogaway, P., Reconciling Two Views of Cryptography (the computational soundness of formal encryption) (2000) LNCS, 1872, pp. 3-22. , Watanabe, O., Hagiya, M., Ito, T., van Leeuwen, J., Mosses, P.D.

Moreover, security demands of these systems are expected to grow, as many applications will require accurate context modeling. In this work we propose an enhancement to the reputation systems traditionally deployed for securing these systems. Different anomaly detectors are combined using the immunological paradigm to optimize reputation system performance in response to evolving security requirements. As an example, the experiments show how a combination of detectors based on unsupervised techniques (self-organizing maps and genetic algorithms) can help to significantly reduce the global response time of the reputation system. The proposed solution offers many benefits: scalability, fast response to adversarial activities, ability to detect unknown attacks, high adaptability, and high ability in detecting and confining attacks. For these reasons, we believe that our solution is capable of coping with the dynamism of ambient intelligence systems and the growing requirements of security demands. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, power networks also tend to be more vulnerable due to the cascading failures from their interdependent information systems, i.e., the failures in the information systems can cause the failures of the coupled portion in power networks. Therefore, the accurate vulnerability assessment of interdependent power networks is of great importance in the presence of unexpected disruptive events or adversarial attacks targeting on critical network nodes. In this paper, we study the Interdependent Power Network Disruptor (IPND) optimization problem to identify critical nodes in an interdependent power network whose removals maximally destroy its functions due to both malfunction of these nodes and the cascading failures of its interdependent communication network. First, we show the IPND problem is NP-hard to be approximated within the factor of (2-\epsilon). Despite its intractability, we propose a greedy framework with novel centrality functions based on the networks' interdependencies, to efficiently solve this problem in a timely manner. An extensive experiment not only illustrates the effectiveness of our approach on networks with different topologies and interdependencies, but also highlights some important observations which help to sharpen the robustness of interdependent networks in the future. © 2013 IEEE.",Algorithm; computational complexity; experiments; interdependent power networks; vulnerability assessment,Cascading failures; Critical networks; Critical node; Disruptive event; NP-hard; Optimization problems; Power networks; Vulnerability assessments; Algorithms; Computational complexity; Experiments; Information systems; Network security; Problem solving; Uncertainty analysis; Electric network analysis,,,,,"Albert, R., Albert, I., Nakarado, G.L., Structural vulnerability of the north american power grid (2004) Phys.

However, such a process can be easily abused or disrupted by adversarial nodes. In absence of a priori trusted nodes, the discovery and verification of neighbor positions presents challenges that have been scarcely investigated in the literature. In this paper, we address this open issue by proposing a fully distributed cooperative solution that is robust against independent and colluding adversaries, and can be impaired only by an overwhelming presence of adversaries. Results show that our protocol can thwart more than 99 percent of the attacks under the best possible conditions for the adversaries, with minimal false positive rates. © 2012 IEEE.",mobile ad hoc networks; Neighbor position verification; vehicular networks,Ad-hoc networking; False positive rates; Location aware services; Mobile nodes; Vehicular networks; Computer networks; Mobile computing; Mobile ad hoc networks,,,,,"(2006) 1609 2-2006: IEEE Trial-Use Standard for Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments-Security Services for Applications and Management Messages, , IEEE; Papadimitratos, P., Buttyan, L., Holczer, T., Schoch, E., Freudiger, J., Raya, M., Ma, Z., Hubaux, J.-P., Secure vehicular communications: Design and architecture (2008) IEEE Comm.

EPCS includes requirements two-factor authentication; specifications for electronic prescription applications; and rules governing the signing, transmitting, and receiving of electronic prescriptions [1]. However, this set of regulations overlooks numerous critical aspects of computer security. This paper highlights some key areas in the electronic prescription process outlined by the EPCS regulation that are susceptible to adversarial attacks and provides recommendations for additions to EPCS regulations that would provide greater security for the use of electronic prescriptions. © 2013 USENIX Workshop on Health Information Technologies, HealthTech 2013.

They do not only steal the sensitive information but also let the hacker to control the computer of users. Malicious website detection with the machine learning technique achieves satisfying result. However, the characteristics of the malicious website may be modified to evade the detection. In this paper, the exploratory attack which misleads the decision of the classifier on the malicious samples by change the feature values with the minimum cost is discussed for malicious website detection. The costs of modifying features of malicious website domain are discussed. The attack model is used to attack the detection system using Support Vector Machine and Fisher Discriminant Classifier. The experimental results show that SVM is more robust than fisher discriminant classifier. Moreover, the vulnerable features are also discussed for the malicious website detection. © 2013 IEEE.",Adversarial Learning; Exploratory attack; Malicious website detection,Adversarial learning; Exploratory attack,,,,,"Ma, J.T., Saul, L.K., Savage, S., Voelker, G.M., Learning to detect malicious URLs (2010) ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST), 2 (3); Kan, M.-Y., Thi, H.O.N., Fast webpage classification using URL features (2005) Proceedings of the 14th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management 2005, pp. 325-326; Garera, S., Provos, N., Chew, M., Rubin, A.D., Framework for detection and measurement of phishing attacks (2007) Proceedings of the 2007 ACM Workshop on Recurring Malcode 2007, pp. 1-8. , A; Yue, Z., Hong, J., Cranor, L., CANTINA: A content-based approach to detecting phishing web sites (2007) Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 639-648; Provos, N., Mavrommatis, P., Rajab, M.A., Monrose, F., All Your iFRAMEs Point to Us (2008) Proceedings of the 17th Conference on Security Symposium 2008, pp. 1-15; Guan, D.J., Chen, C.-M., Lin, J.-B., Anomaly based malicious URL detection in instant messaging (2009) Workshop on Information Security, JWIS; Xiao, H., Xiao, H., Adversarial and Secure Machine Learning, , http://www.sec.in.tum.de/adversarial-and-secure-machine-Iearning; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., Can machine learning be secure?

These formulations capture trade-offs in terms of attack impact on the control performance, attack detectability, and adversarial resources. The formulations are then discussed and related to system theoretic concepts, followed by numerical examples illustrating the various trade-offs for a quadruple-tank process. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.",Impact Analysis; Networked Control Systems; Security,Commerce; Constrained optimization; Embedded systems; Network security; Networked control systems; Adversary modeling; Constrained optimi-zation problems; Control performance; Cyber security; Detectability; False-data injection attacks; Impact analysis; Security; Control system analysis,,,,,"Boyd, S., Vandenberghe, L., (2004) Convex Optimization, , Cambridge University Press; Cárdenas, A., Amin, S., Lin, Z., Huang, Y., Huang, C., Sastry, S., Attacks against process control systems: Risk assessment, detection, and response (2011) Proceedings of the 6th ACM Symposium on Information, Computer and Communications Security, ASIACCS 2011, pp. 355-366. , ACM, New York; Ding, S.X., (2008) Model-based Fault Diagnosis Techniques: Design Schemes, , Springer; Esfahani, P., Vrakopoulou, M., Margellos, K., Lygeros, J., Andersson, G., Cyber attack in a two-area power system: Impact identification using reachability (2010) American Control Conference, pp. 962-967. , In:, (July; Fawzi, H., Tabuada, P., Diggavi, S., Security for control systems under sensor and actuator attacks (2012) Proceedings of the 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, , In:, Maui, Hawaii, USA (December; Hwang, I., Kim, S., Kim, Y., Seah, C.E., A survey of fault detection, isolation, and reconfiguration methods (2010) IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology, 18 (3), pp. 636-653; Johansson, K., The quadruple-tank process: A multivariable laboratory process with an adjustable zero (2000) IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology, 8 (3), pp. 456-465; Liu, J., Ye, J., (2010) Efficient L1/Lq Norm Regularization, , ArXiv e-prints (September); Marler, R.T., Arora, J.S., Survey of multi-objective optimization methods for engineering (2004) Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 26 (6), pp. 369-395; Meserve, J., (2007) Sources: Staged cyber attack reveals vulnerability in power grid, , http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/09/26/power.at.risk/index.html, CNN; Pasqualetti, F., Dorfler, F., Bullo, F., Cyber-physical attacks in power networks: Models, fundamental limitations and monitor design (2011) Proc. of the 50th IEEE Conf. on Decision and Control and European Control Conference, , In:, Orlando, FL, USA (December; Rid, T., Cyber war will not take place (2011) Journal of Strategic Studies, 35 (1), pp. 5-32; Sandberg, H., Teixeira, A., Johansson, K.H., On security indices for state estimators in power networks (2010) Preprints of the First Workshop on Secure Control Systems, , In:, CPSWEEK 2010, Stockholm, Sweden (April; Smith, R., A decoupled feedback structure for covertly appropriating networked control systems (2011) Proc. of the 18th IFAC World Congress, , In:, Milano, Italy (AugustSeptember; Sundaram, S., Hadjicostis, C., Distributed function calculation via linear iterative strategies in the presence of malicious agents (2011) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 56 (7), pp. 1495-1508; Stuxnet introduces the first known rootkit for industrial control systems (2010) Symantec, , http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/stuxnet-introduces-first-known-rootkit-scada-devices, Symantec, August 6; Teixeira, A., Shames, I., Sandberg, H., Johansson, K.H., (2012) A Secure Control Framework for Resource-Limited Adversaries, , Submitted to Automatica (December) ArXiv e-prints; Tokarzewski, J., (2006) Finite zeros in discrete time control systems, 338. , LNCIS,.

It first introduces the concept of the ultra-tactical as an additional realm of operations in the traditional strategic-operational-tactical framework. The context of this realm is compared to human cognitive processes as well as machine processes used to aid human decision making. Potential biases intrinsic in both processes are identified and evaluated. Factors that contribute to the complexity of cyberspace environment in ultra-tactical time scales are reviewed and the potential impact of emergent events on automated decision making protocols are examined. Futuring methodologies are used to develop feasible operational scenarios which are in turn used to evaluate the benefits and risks inherent in implementing automated responses that operate without human cognitive interaction. Specific focus of the analysis includes determining if automated responses will be robust enough to accommodate the dynamic nature of cyberspace and if they can differentiate adversarial threats from natural emergent behavior. © 2013 NATO Coop Cyber Def Ctr.",automated response; complexity; emergence; futuring scenarios,Automation; Risk perception; Automated decision making; Automated response; Cognitive interaction; complexity; emergence; futuring scenarios; Human decision making; Operational scenario; Computers,,,,,"Panetta, L., (2012) Remarks on Cybersecurity to the Business Executives for National Security, , New York, 11 October; Alexander, K., (2012) Statement before the House Committee on Armed Services, , Washington, D.

By analyzing three prominent case studies, I show that as a result of geopolitical tensions, cyber attacks were implemented to further nation state objectives in support of foreign policy considerations and failed to achieve their respective outcomes despite successful deployment against their intended targets. The three case studies, hypothetical scenarios because attribution has not been confirmed, include: (1) the October 2012 distributed denial of service attacks targeting the U.S. banking sector; (2) the 2012 Stuxnet attack against Iran; and (3) the 2007 cyber attacks against Estonia. I work with the assumption that nation states were orchestrating the attacks through proxies, or else were actual participants, based on intent, motive, and a plethora of circumstantial evidence presented in each scenario. Data has been collected from newspapers, information technology security periodicals, and expert analysis. This paper challenges the notion that states can use the threat of cyber attack to influence an adversarial nation state's behavior, much the same way the threat of nuclear weapons holds other states in check. © 2013 NATO Coop Cyber Def Ctr.",cyber attack; DDOS; Estonia; foreign policy; Iran; Stuxnet,Denial-of-service attack; Information technology; Network security; Nuclear weapons; Cyber-attacks; DDOS; Estonia; Foreign policy; Iran; Stuxnet; Crime,,,,,"Brodkin, J., Government-sponsored cyberattacks on the rise, mcafee says (2007) Network World; McAfee, , http://www.networkworld.com/news/2007/112907-government-cyberattacks.Html, November 29; Nakashima, E., Miller, G., Tate, J., (2012) U.

In this context, we study the Cascading Vulnerability Node Detection (CVND) optimization problem to identify the most vulnerable nodes in a network whose removals maximally destroy the network's functions after cascading failures, based on the recently proposed effective metric, total pairwise connectivity. Besides its NP-hardness on various graphs, we further show that the CVND problem is NP-hard to be approximated within equation with n vertices and k vulnerable nodes after d-hop failure cascades. Despite the intractability of this problem, we propose TRGA, a novel iterative two-phase algorithm, for efficiently solving the CVND problem in a timely manner. We also formulate the integer linear programming for obtaining the optimal solution. The effectiveness of our solutions is validated on various synthetic and real-world networks. © 2013 IEEE.",Algorithm; Cascading Failure; Complex Networks; Inapproximability; Network Structure Analysis,Algorithms; Communication; Complex networks; Integer programming; Iterative methods; Optimization; Problem solving; Uncertainty analysis; Cascading failures; Inapproximability; Integer Linear Programming; Network structures; Network vulnerability; Optimization problems; Pairwise connectivities; Two phase algorithm; Network security,,,,,"http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/pajek/data/gphs.htm; http://www.cablemap.info/; Albert, R., Jeong, H., Barabasi, Error and attack tolerance of complex networks (2000) Nature, 406 (6794), pp. 378-382; Arulselvan, A., Commander, C.W., Elefteriadou, L., Pardalos, P.M., Detecting critical nodes in sparse graphs (2009) Comput.

In this game, the pursuer aims to minimize the capture time of the last surviving evader, while the evaders as a team cooperate to maximize this time. We present a gradient-based approach that quickly computes the controls for the evaders as a team under an open-loop formulation that is conservative towards the evader team by deriving analytical formulas. We demonstrate the advantage of the gradient based approach by comparing performance both in computation time and in optimality with the iterative open-loop method studied in our previous work. Multiple heuristics have been designed to deal with the inherent intractability of evaluating all possible capture sequences. Extensive simulations have been performed, with results discussed.

The higher the degree of such intrusion is, the more effective an attack will be. Consider, however, an adversary that is far from omnipotent: How should she attack, how should she deploy her resources to maximally affect the attacked WSN operation? This basic question has received little attention, with one approach considering genetic algorithms for devising an attack strategy [5]. In this work, we recast the problem towards a more systematic treatment and more computationally efficient solutions: a combination of a genetic algorithm with a convex relaxation, and an ℓ1- constraint formulation. The devising of near-optimal attack strategies efficiently strengthens the adversary, allowing her to adapt and mount effective and thus harmful attacks even in complex and dynamically changing settings. © 2013 EURASIP.",Attack; cryptographic key; genetic algorithm (GA); security,Relaxation processes; Sensor nodes; Signal processing; Attack; Attack strategies; Computationally efficient; Convex relaxation; Cryptographic key; security; Various attacks; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Genetic algorithms,,,,,"Bohli, J.M., Papadimitratos, P., Verardi, D., Westhoff, D., Resilient data aggregation for unattended wsns (2011) Proc.

In this paper, we propose a novel random ceiling padding approach whose results are resistant to such adversarial knowledge. Specifically, the approach injects randomness into the process of forming padding groups, such that an adversary armed with background knowledge would still face sufficient uncertainty in estimating user inputs. We formally present a generic scheme and discuss two concrete instantiations. We then confirm the correctness and performance of our approach through both theoretic analysis and experiments with two real world applications. © 2013 IEEE.",Background Knowledge; Indistinguishability; Privacy Preservation; Side-Channel Attack; Traffic Padding; Uncertainty; Web Application,Software as a service (SaaS); Web services; Back-ground knowledge; Indistinguishability; Privacy preservation; Side channel attack; Uncertainty; WEB application; Uncertainty analysis,,,,,"Aggarwal, G., Feder, T., Kenthapadi, K., Motwani, R., Panigrahy, R., Thomas, D., Zhu, A., Anonymizing tables (2005) ICDT, 5, pp. 246-258; Askarov, A., Zhang, D., Myers, A.C., Predictive black-box mitigation of timing channels (2010) CCS, 10, pp. 297-307; Asonov, D., Agrawal, R., Keyboard acoustic emanations (2004) Security and Privacy IEEE Symposium on, p. 3; Backes, M., Doychev, G., D̈urmuth, M., K̈opf, B., Speaker recognition in encrypted voice streams (2010) ESORICS, 10, pp. 508-523; Brumley, D., Dan, B., Remote timing attacks are practical (2003) USENIX, 3, pp. 1-1; Castelluccia, C., De Cristofaro, E., Perito, D., Private information disclosure from web searches (2010) PETS?10, pp. 38-55; Chen, S., Wang, R., Wang, X., Zhang, K., Side-channel leaks in web applications: A reality today, a challenge tomorrow (2010) IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy?10, pp. 191-206; Cynthia, D., Differential privacy (2006) ICALP, (2), pp. 1-12; Felten, E.W., Schneider, M.A., Timing attacks on web privacy (2000) CCS, 0, pp. 25-32; Fong, L.P.W., Anwar, M., Zhen, Z., A privacy preservation model for facebook-style social network systems (2009) ESORICS, 9, pp. 303-320; Freudiger, J., Manshaei, M.H., Hubaux, J.-P., Parkes, D.C., On noncooperative location privacy: A game-theoretic analysis (2009) CCS, 9, pp. 324-337; Benjamin, C., Fung, M., Wang, K., Chen, R., Yu, P.S., Privacypreserving data publishing: A survey of recent developments ACM Comput.

In this paper, we study how physically independent systems can be made interdependent in the CPS context. In order to understand such interdependencies, we establish a system framework to investigate the effect of cyber coupling on physical control systems. In particular, we study the optimal control of networked control system jointly with power control problems in wireless communication networks. We show that the information exchange between cyber and physical layers not only makes the control system more efficient but also enhances its resilience to adversarial behaviors. In addition, as a result of interdependencies, a jamming attack on one CPS can benefit the performance of the other CPS. We use a two-CPS case study to demonstrate performance of the coupled system at both the physical and cyber layers. © 2013 IEEE.",,Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Information dissemination; Network layers; Power control; Wireless telecommunication systems; Independent systems; Information exchanges; Networked cyber-physical systems; Physical control systems; Physical resources; Power control problem; System framework; Wireless communication network; Networked control systems,,,,,"Alpcan, T., Başar, T., Srikant, R., Altman, E., CDMA uplink power control as a noncooperative game (2002) Wireless Networks, 8, pp. 659-670; Alpcan, T., Başar, T., Dey, S., A power control game based on outage probabilities for multicell wireless data networks (2006) IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, 5 (4), pp. 890-899. , April; Zhu, Q., Pavel, L., State-space approach to pricing design in OSNR Nash game (2008) Proc. of the IFAC World Congress, pp. 12001-12006. , July; Kandukuri, S., Boyd, S., Optimal power control in interferencelimited fading wireless channels with outage-probability specifications (2002) IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, 1 (1), pp. 46-55. , Jan; Zhu, Q., Pavel, L., Enabling differentiated services using generalized power control model in optical networks (2009) IEEE Transactions on Communications, 57 (9), pp. 2570-2575. , Sept; Yuksel, S., Başar, T., Stochastic Networked Control Systems: Stabilization and Optimization under Information Constraints, , Systems &Control: Foundations and Applications Series, Birkhauser, Boston, MA, June 2013; Imer, O.C., Yuksel, S., Başar, T., Optimal control of LTI systems over unreliable communication links (2006) Automatica, 42 (9), pp. 1429-1440. , Sept; Tarraf, D.C., Control of Cyber-Physical Systems: Workshop Held at the, 449. , Johns Hopkins University, March 2013, Lecture Notes in Control and Information Sciences (LNCIS) , March 2013; Zhu, Q., Bushnell, L., Başar, T., Resilient distributed control of multi-agent cyber-physical systems Proc. of the Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS) Workshop on Control of Cyber-Physical Systems, pp. 301-316. , LNCIS 449, March 2013; Zhu, Q., Başar, T., A dynamic game-Theoretic approach to resilient control system design for cascading failures Proc. of the 1st Conference on High Confidence Networked Systems (HiCoNS), pp. 41-46. , Part of CPSWeek 2012, April 2012; Zhu, Q., Başar, T., Toward robust and resilient control design for cyber-physical systems with an application to power systems (2011) Proc. of the 50th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control and European Control Conference (CDC/ECC), pp. 4066-4072. , Dec; Antsaklis, P.J., Goodwine, B., Gupta, V., McCourt, M.J., Wang, Y., Wu, P., Xia, M., Zhu, F., Control of cyberphysical systems using passivity and dissipativity based methods (2013) European Journal of Control, 19 (5), pp. 379-388. , Sept; Wang, X., Hovakimyan, N., Sha, L., L1Simplex: Fault-Tolerant control of cyber-physical systems Proc. of the ACM/IEEE 4th International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS), pp. 41-50. , Part of CPSWeek 2013, April 2013; Başar, T., Olsder, G.J., Dynamic noncooperative game theory (1999) SIAM Series in Classics in Applied Mathematics, , Jan; Proakis, J., (2000) Digital Communications, , McGraw-Hill 4th edition Aug; Poovendran, R., Cyber-physical systems: Close encounters between two parallel worlds [Point of View] (2010) Proceedings of the IEEE, 98 (8), pp. 1363-1366. , Aug; Tse, D., Viswanath, P., (2005) Fundamentals of Wireless Communication, , Cambridge University Press",,,Coordinated Science Laboratory;Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,IEEE Computer Society,"51st Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing, Allerton 2013",2 October 2013 through 4 October 2013,"Monticello, IL",104107,,9.78148E+12,,,English,"Annu.

Although these types of algorithm are vulnerable to several types of security attack, less work has been done to implement secure localisation algorithms that are able to work in a hostile environment. An attacker could compromise, or masquerade as, a beacon node and send incorrect location information. Localisation in a hostile environment is a critical problem in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) because compromising the localisation system could disturb and subvert the entire functioning of the WSN. In this paper we investigate the security of recently proposed localisation algorithm, called ALWadHA, which enables nodes to live with the malicious reference nodes without disturbing the location estimation. © 2013 IEEE.",ALWadHA; attack resitance; malicious node; secure localisation,Algorithms; ALWadHA; attack resitance; Hostile environments; Localisation; Localisation Systems; Location information; Malicious nodes; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Sensor nodes,,,,,"Boukerche, A., Oliveira, H., Nakamura, E.F., Loureiro, A.A., Secure localization algorithms for wireless sensor networks (2008) IEEE Communications Magazine, 46, pp. 96-101; Abu-Mahfouz, A.M., Hancke, G.P., Distance bounding: A practical security solution for real-time location systems ?

Many of these services (such as NFC payments) are highly sensitive and can be abused by malicious entities, without the knowledge of the device user, in the form of insider attacks (such as malware) and/or outsider attacks (such as unauthorized reading and relay attacks). In this paper, we present a novel application permission granting approach that can be used to protect any sensitive mobile device service. It captures user's intent to access the service via a lightweight hand waving gesture. This gesture is very simple, quick and intuitive for the user, but would be very hard for the attacker to exhibit without user's knowledge. We present the design and implementation of a hand waving gesture recognition mechanism using an ambient light sensor, already available on most mobile devices. We integrate this gesture with the phone dialing service as a specific use case to address the problem of malware that makes premium rate phone calls. We also report on our experiments to analyze the performance of our approach both in benign and adversarial settings. Our results indicate the approach to be quite effective in preventing the misuse of sensitive resources while imposing only minimal user burden. © Springer International Publishing 2013.",,Computer crime;

Recent work by Liu et al.has renewed interest in the seminal work by Lin on structural controllability, providing a graph-theoretical interpretation. This allows the identification of driver nodes capable of forcing the system into a desired state, which implies an obvious target for attackers wishing to disrupt the network control. Several methods for identifying driver nodes exist, but require undesirable computational complexity. In this paper, we therefore investigate the ability to regain or maintain controllability in the presence of adversaries able to remove vertices and implicit edges of the controllability graph. For this we rely on the Power Dominating Set (PDS) formulation for identifying the control structure and study different attack strategies for multiple network models. As the construction of a PDS for a given graph is not unique, we further investigate different strategies for PDS construction, and provide a simulative evaluation. © 2013 Springer International Publishing.",Attack Models; Complex Networks; Structural Controllability,Complex networks; Controllability; Graph theory; Attack model; Control structure; Critical infrastructure systems; Different attacks; Different domains; Multiple networks; Power dominating sets; Structural controllability; Critical infrastructures,,,,,"Kalman, R.E., Mathematical description of linear dynamical systems (1963) Journal of the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics Control Series A, 1, pp. 152-192; Lin, C.-T., Structual Controllability (1974) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 19 (3), pp. 201-208; Liu, Y.-Y., Slotine, J.-J., Barabási, A.-L., Controllability of Complex Networks (2011) Nature, 473, pp. 167-173; Wang, W.-X., Ni, X., Lai, Y.-C., Grebogi, C., Optimizing controllability of complex networks by minimum structural perturbations (2012) Physical Review E, 85 (2), p. 026115; Pu, C.-L., Pei, W.-J., Michaelson, A., Robustness analysis of network controllability (2012) Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications, 391 (18), pp. 4420-4425; Downey, R.G., Fellows, M.R., Parameterized Complexity (1999) Monographs in Computer Science, , Springer, Heidelberg; Micali, S., Vazirani, V.V., An O(√|V||E |) Algorithm for Finding Maximum Matching in General Graphs (1980) Proceedings of the 21st Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS 1980), Syracuse, NY, USA, pp. 17-27. , Book, R.V.

Unlike traditional intrusion detection systems that use the network features and system behavior for attack detection, we leverage the predictability property of the AMI data. Electricity usage reports and pricing information constitute the major parts of the data traffic in AMI. Considering that electricity consumption patterns of customers follow a statistical model, which is a function of time and price, we introduce long-term anomaly detection and instantaneous anomaly detection of consumption patterns to detect adversarial activities in AMI with long term and short term effects, respectively. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed approach in detecting various types of adversarial activities against AMI is demonstrated through simulations. © 2013 IEEE.",,Intrusion detection; Anomaly detection; Consumption patterns; Electricity consumption patterns; Electricity usage; Intrusion Detection Systems; Short-term effects; Statistical modeling; System behaviors; Advanced metering infrastructures,,,,,"Chen, T.M., Survey of cyber security issues in smart grids (2010) Proc. of SPIE, , April; (2010) Nistir Guidelines for Smart Grid Cyber Security, 1. , August; Wright, J., (2010) Smart Meters Have Security Holes, , http://www.msnbc.com/id/36055667; Kush, N., Ernest, F., Ahmed, E., Ahmed, I., Clark, A., Gap analysis of intrusion detection in smart grids (2011) Proceedings of the 2nd International Cyber Resilience Conference, , secau, August; Berthier, R., Khurana, H., Intrusion detection for advanced metering infrastructures: Requirements and architectural directions (2010) IEEE SmartGridComm, , October; Wang, L., Sun, W., Green, R., Alam, M., Distributed intrusion detection system in a multi-layer network architecture of smart grids (2011) IEEE Transaction on Smart Grid, 2 (4), pp. 796-808. , December; Jokar, P., Nicanfar, H., Leung, V.C., Specification-based intrusion detection for home area networks in smart grids (2011) IEEE SmartGrid- Comm, , October; Depuru, S., Wang, L., Devabhaktuni, V., Support vector machine based data classification for detection of electricity theft (2011) IEEE/PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition, , March; Sieh, K., Ahmed, S., Mohamad, M., Nontechnical loss detection for metered customers in power utility using support vector machines (2010) IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, 25 (2), pp. 1162-1171. , April; Saavedra, O., Cortes, O., De Souza, A., Detection and identification of abnormalities in customer consumptions in power distribution systems (2011) IEEE Transaction on Power Delivery, 26 (4), pp. 2436-2442. , October; Burges, C.J.C., A tutorial on support vector machines for pattern recognition (1998) Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 2 (2), pp. 121-167; Karnouskos, S., De Holanda, T., Simulation of a smart grid city with software agents (2009) Third UKSim European Symposium on Computer Modeling and Simulation, , November",,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications, ICC 2013",9 June 2013 through 13 June 2013,Budapest,101510,15503607,9.78147E+12,,,English,IEEE Int Conf Commun,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891362282,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cooperative sensing is an effective solution to improve sensing accuracy and robustness in the presence of fading and shadowing that make individual sensing less reliable. However, when an adversary can corrupt some nodes in the network, the effectiveness of cooperative sensing may degrade dramatically. We design the first fully distributed security scheme ReDiSen to counter attacks in cooperative sensing. We apply reputation generated from exchanged sensing results as an aid to restrict the impact of the malicious behaviours. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate that ReDiSen provides an effective countermeasure against security attacks by enabling secondary users to obtain more accurate cooperative sensing results in adversarial environments. ReDiSen does not rely on a central authority, nor a common control channel, and is therefore more applicable in dynamic cognitive radio networks. © 2013 IEEE.",Cognitive Radio Networks; Cooperative Sensing; Reputation; Security,Cognitive radio; Wireless telecommunication systems; Adversarial environments; Cognitive radio network; Cognitive radio techniques; Common control channels; Cooperative sensing; Reputation; Security; Wireless communications; Radio systems,,,,,"Buchegger, S., Boudec, J.-Y.L., Self-policing mobile ad-hoc networks by reputation systems (2005) IEEE Communications Magazine, pp. 101-107. , July; Kaligineedi, P., Khabbazian, M., Bhargava, V., Malicious user detection in a cognitive radio cooperative sensing system (2010) IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, 9 (8), pp. 2488-2497; Li, Z., Yu, F.R., Huang, M., A cooperative spectrum sensing consensus scheme in cognitive radios (2009) Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM); Mishra, S.M., Sahai, A., Brodersen, R.W., Cooperative sensing among crs (2006) Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC); Yan, Q., Li, M., Jiang, T., Lou, W., Hou, Y.T., Vulnerability and protection for distributed consensus-based spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks (2012) Proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM; Fatemieh, O., Farhadi, A., Chandra, R., Gunter, C.A., Using classification to protect the integrity of spectrum measurements in white space networks (2011) 18th Annual Network & Distributed System Security Symposium; Akyildiz, I.F., Lo, B.F., Balakrishnan, R., Cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks: A survey (2011) Physical Communication, 4, pp. 40-62; Min, A.W., Shin, K.G., Hu, X., Attack-tolerant distributed sensing for dynamic spectrum access networks (2009) Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP); Chen, R., Park, J.-M., Bian, K., Robust distributed spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks (2008) Proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM; Li, H., Han, Z., Catch me if you can: An abnormality detection approach for collaborative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks (2010) IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, , November; Min, A.W., Kim, K.H., Shin, K.G., Robust cooperative sensing via state estimation in cognitive radio networks (2011) Proceedings of IEEE Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN); Wang, W., Li, H., Sun, Y., Han, Z., Catchit: Detect malicious nodes in collaborative spectrum sensing (2009) Proceedings of IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference (GLOBECOM); Olfati-Saber, R., Fax, J.A., Murray, R.M., Consensus and cooperation in networked multi-agent systems (2007) Proceedings of the IEEE, 95 (1), pp. 215-233; Wei, J., Zhang, X., Two-tier optimal-cooperation based secure distributed spectrum sensing for wireless cognitive radio networks (2010) Proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM",,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications, ICC 2013",9 June 2013 through 13 June 2013,Budapest,101510,15503607,9.78147E+12,,,English,IEEE Int Conf Commun,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891361827,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One can fundamentally think of it as delayed release for a determined adversary. This approach is not well suited for long-term archival of sensitive data. Additionally, issues such as key rotation, and lost or exposed keys, make keeping such archives up to date very difficult. As a result most become static and unable to respond to attacks. Once hacked, such systems offer little to no protection for data privacy and leave open uncertainty about data integrity. Given the increasing frequency of major cyber events these days, it is clear that any secure long-term archive needs to be able to address maintaining data privacy and integrity throughout a compromise event. In spite of these needs, most data archives today still use central storage servers and encryption. In this paper we make the case for secure data archival based on secret splitting and distributed data repositories. We present Percival, one example of a research project focused on long-term data archival using Shamir's secret splitting and distributed data repositories. We examine how this approach can continue secure operations in the presence of adversarial compromise. We discuss how this distributed model significantly increases the attacker's burden by requiring the compromise of many sites. Additionally, this approach increases the resilience to insider threat and provides stronger assurances of data integrity and confidentiality. Finally we discuss current research to create new capabilities that enable blinded search across such an archive. © 2013 IEEE.",,Control systems; Cryptography; Data privacy; Research; Data integrity; Delayed release; Distributed data; Distributed modeling; Insider Threat; Secret-splitting; Sensitive datas; Storage servers; Digital storage,,,,,"Bellovin, S., Cheswick, W., Privacy-enhanced searches using encrypted bloom filters (2004) Technical Report 2004/022, IACR EPrint Cryptography Archive; Boneh, D., Crescenzo, G.D., Ostrovsky, R., Persiano, G., Public key encryption with keyword search (2004) Advances in Cryptology-EUROCRYPT 2004, International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques; Chang, Y.C., Mitzenmacher, M., Privacy preserving keyword searches on remote encrypted data (2005) Applied Cryptography and Network Security Conference; Curtmola, R., Garay, J., Kamara, S., Ostrovsky, R., Searchable symmetric encryption: Improved definitions and efficient constructions (2006) Proceedings of the 13th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security; Huchton, S., Xie, G., Beverly, R., Building and evaluating a kresilient mobile distributed file system resistant to device compromise (2011) Proceedings of the Military Communications Conference (MILCOM), , Nov; Shamir, A., How to share a secret (1979) Communications of the ACM, 22 (11), pp. 612-613. , Nov; Song, D.X., Wagner, D., Perrig, A., Practical techniques for searches on encrypted data (2000) Proceedings of the 2000 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 44-55. , May; Storer, M.W., Greenan, K.M., Miller, E.L., Voruganti, K., POTSHARDS-a secure, recoverable, long-term archival storage system (2009) ACM Transactions on Storage, 5 (2). , June; Wang, Q., Borisov, N., Octopus: A secure and anonymous dht lookup (2012) CoRR; Shamir's secret sharing - wikipedia (2013) The Free Encyclopedia, , Wikipedia; Zage, D., Obert, J., Linear subspaces to improve cloud security (2012) Dependable Systems and Networks Workshops (DSN-W), 2012 IEEE/IFIP 42nd International Conference on, pp. 1-6. , June",,,Center for Advanced Energy Studies (CAES);Idaho National Laboratory (INL);IEEE Industrial Electronics Society (IES);Temple University;The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE),IEEE Computer Society,"2013 6th International Symposium on Resilient Control Systems, ISRCS 2013",13 August 2013 through 15 August 2013,"San Francisco, CA",101345,,9.78148E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

Nevertheless, these systems are vulnerable to deliberate false or unfair testimonies. In one scenario, the attackers collude to give negative feedback on the victim in order to lower or destroy its reputation. This attack is known as bad mouthing attack. In another scenario, a number of entities agree to give positive feedback on an entity (often with adversarial intentions). This attack is known as ballot stuffing. Both attack types can significantly deteriorate the performances of the network. The existing solutions for coping with these attacks are mainly concentrated on prevention techniques. In this work, we propose a solution that detects and isolates the abovementioned attackers, impeding them in this way to further spread their malicious activity. The approach is based on detecting outliers using clustering, in this case self-organizing maps. An important advantage of this approach is that we have no restrictions on training data, and thus there is no need for any data pre-processing. Testing results demonstrate the capability of the approach in detecting both bad mouthing and ballot stuffing attack in various scenarios. © The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press.

In this paper, we study Critical Link Disruptor (CLD) and Critical Node Disruptor (CND) optimization problems to identify critical links and nodes in a network whose removals maximally destroy the network's functions. We provide a comprehensive complexity analysis of CLD and CND on general graphs and show that they still remain NP-complete even on unit disk graphs and power-law graphs. Furthermore, the CND problem is shown NP-hard to be approximated within Omega left (n-k over n epsilon right) on general graphs with n vertices and k critical nodes. Despite the intractability of these problems, we propose HILPR, a novel LP-based rounding algorithm, for efficiently solving CLD and CND problems in a timely manner. The effectiveness of our solutions is validated on various synthetic and real-world networks. © 1993-2012 IEEE.",Computational complexity; experiments; inapproximability; network Vulnerability,Complexity analysis; Critical networks; Inapproximability; Network vulnerability; Optimization problems; Real-world networks; Rounding algorithm; Unit disk graphs; Complex networks; Computational complexity; Diamonds; Experiments; Uncertainty analysis; Network security,,,,,"September 11 Attacks, , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/september_11_attacks; http://networkx.lanl.gov/reference/generated/networkx.generators. random_graphs.barabasi_albert_graph.html, barabasi-albert-graph; http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/pajek/data/gphs.htm, Networks/Pajek; http://www.cablemap.info/, Greg's cable map; http://www.xo.com/about/network/pages/maps.aspx, Network maps; Albert, R., Albert, I., Nakarado, G.L., Structural vulnerability of the North American power grid (2004) Phys.

In order to measure network robustness, we propose a new metric, called persistence, which better captures the notion of robustness than the widely known connectivity based metrics. We study two variants of the sink deployment problem: sink selection and sink placement. We prove that both problems are NP-hard, and show how the problem of sink placement can be traced back to the problem of sink selection using an optimal search space reduction technique, which may be of independent interest. To solve the problem of sink selection, we propose efficient heuristic algorithms. Finally, we provide experimental results on the performance of our proposed algorithms.© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

First, the article analyzes the terrorist attacks perpetrated by jihadists on March 11, 2004, three days before Spain's general election. The indiscriminate, lethal attacks caused a state of shock in the country, brought the election campaign to a sudden end, and led to the defeat of the party in power. Second, the article analyzes the negotiations entered into with the ETA terrorist organization by the new government during its first term, from 2004 to 2008. This controversial step, upheld by the Spanish government despite massive opposition by civil society and the main opposition party, failed to bring about the end of ETA. Both the Madrid attacks and the negotiations with ETA were responsible for the breakdown of the consensus in regard to terrorism that had existed among the main Spanish political parties. The article analyzes how both events generated an unprecedented level of polarization and tension among political parties and society from 2004 to 2008, and how each event had a different impact on the general elections held during that period. The period under examination provides an example of adversarial politics; terrorism was highly influenced by the management of both events by the main political players. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Elections; Negotiations with terrorists; Party politics; Political violence; Terrorism,,,,,,"http://www.cis.es, See for example the regular surveys carried out by Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas (CIS), held at the database of the Spanish Centre for Sociological Research; Alonso, R., Reinares, F., Terrorism, Human Rights and Law Enforcement in Spain (2005) Terrorism and Political Violence, 17 (1-2), pp. 265-278; Study, 2, p. 561. , http://www.cis.es/cis/opencms/-Archivos/Marginales/2560_2579/2561/Es2561.pdf, Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas (CIS), April 2004; Study, 2, p. 584. , http://www.cis.es/cis/opencms/-Archivos/Marginales/2580_2599/2584/Es2584.pdf, Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas (CIS), December 2004; Agreement for Freedom and Against Terrorism, signed in Madrid on December 12, 2000, by the Popular Party and the Spanish Socialist Workers Party; Antonio, O.J., Ataques Políticos: La Negatividad En Los Debates Televisados De Las Eelecciones De 2008 Congreso Internacional de Estudios Electorales: Partidos, Elecciones y Calidad de la Democracia en la Globalizació n, Salamanca, October 28-30, 2009; Bouza, F., González, J.J., Las Razones Del Voto En La España Democrática (2009), Madrid: Libros de la Catarata; For a thorough chronology of the events and actions of the main players involved in the management of the crisis; Antonio, O.J., Miedo o Engaño: El Encuadramiento De Los Aatentados Terroristas Del 11-M En Madrid Y La Rendición De Cuentas Electoral (2005), Madrid: Real Instituto Elcano, Working Paper N° 24/2005, 24/06/2005; For a chronology of the main events and actions of the main Spanish political parties during the negotiation with ETA; Alonso, R., Una Evaluación de las Dinámicas Psicosociales Relacionadas con la Organización Terrorista ETA y la Política Antiterrorista del Gobierno Español entre 2004 y 2008 (2009) Revista De Psicología Social, 24 (2), pp. 261-290; For a statistical analysis of the casualties caused by several terrorist groups in Spain since the late sixties; Alonso, R., España En La Encrucijada Del Terrorismo: De ETA a Al Qaeda (2008), pp. 781-808. , in Manuel Jiménez de Parga and Fernando Vallespín, eds., La Política, Volumen II de Salustiano del Campo and José Fé lix Tezanos (Coordinators), España en el Siglo XXI (Madrid: Biblioteca Nueva; For an analysis of ETA's patterns of victimization and target selection throughout its terrorist campaign; Alonso, R., Domínguez, F., García, M., Rotas, V., Historia De Los Hombres, Mujeres Y Niños Víctimas De ETA (2010), Madrid: Espasa; Reinares, F., The Madrid Bombings And Global Jihadism (2010) Survival: Global Politics and Strategy, 52 (2), pp. 83-104; Alonso, R., The Madrid Attacks on March 11: An Analysis of the Jihadist Threat in Spain and Main Counterterrorist Measures (2007) Countering Terrorism In the 21st Century: International Perspectives, pp. 202-221. , in James Forest, ed, Westport: Praeger Security International; Alonso, R., Reinares, F., Maghreb Immigrants Becoming Suicide Terrorists: A Case Study on Religious Radicalization Process in Spain (2006) Root Causes of Suicide Terrorism: The Globalization of Martyrdom, pp. 179-198. , in Ami Pedahzur, ed, London: Routledge; Two of the main Spanish newspapers, El Mundo and El País, engaged in a very unusual and bitter exchange of accusations and criticism vis-à-vis the terrorist massacre; Como Dos Gotas De Agua (II) Víctor de la Serna, El Mundo, October 2, 2006; Emplazamiento Público a 'El País': ¿Avala a Su Corresponsal En París?, , El Mundo, editorial, February 19, 2007; El Representante De 'El País' En Francia Pide El Cierre De El Mundo Y La Cope El Mundo, February 19, 2007; El Precio que 'El País' Está Dispuesto a Pagar Víctor De La Serna, , El Mundo, September 14, 2006; Contraatacantes por Cuenta Ajena Víctor De La Serna, , El Mundo, September 16, 2006; Como dos Gotas de Agua,' Víctor De La Serna, , El Mundo, October 1, 2006; Inmoralidad El País, editorial, September 14, 2006; El Cuento De Los Confidentes Que 'Anticiparon' El 11-M E.
