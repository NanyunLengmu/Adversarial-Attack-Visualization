The proposed method models the different classes of adversarial attacks against CPSs, including cross-domain attacks, i.e., cyber-to-cyber and cyber-to-physical attacks. It also takes the secondary consequences of attacks on CPSs into consideration. The intrusion process of attackers has been modeled using attack graph and the consequence estimation process of the attack has been investigated using process model. The security attributes and the special parameters involved in the security analysis of CPSs, have been identified and considered. The quantitative evaluation has been done using the probability of attacks, time-toshutdown of the system and security risks. The validation phase of the proposed model is performed as a case study by applying it to a boiling water power plant and estimating the suitable security measures. © 2015 IEEE.",attack consequences; Cyber-physical systems; modeling; quantitative security evaluation,Computer crime; Models; Real time systems; Risks; attack consequences; Consequence estimation; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Intrusion process; Probability of attack; Quantitative evaluation; Quantitative security evaluation; Security attributes; Embedded systems,,,,,"Madan, B., A method for modeling and quantifying the security attributes of intrusion tolerant systems (2004) Performance Evaluation, 56 (1), pp. 167-186; Krotofil, M., Larsen, J., Are you threatening my hazards?

However, little has been done to understand and verify the formal security guarantees of proposed secure inter-domain routing protocols, such as Secure BGP (S-BGP). In this paper, we develop a sound program logic for SANDLog—a declarative specification language for secure routing protocols—for verifying properties of these protocols. We prove invariant properties of SANDLog programs that run in an adversarial environment. As a step towards automated verification, we implement a verification condition generator (VCGen) to automatically extract proof obligations. VCGen is integrated into a compiler for SANDLog that can generate executable protocol implementations; and thus, both verification and empirical evaluation of secure routing protocols can be carried out in this unified framework. To validate our framework, we encoded several proposed secure routing mechanisms in SANDLog, verified variants of path authenticity properties by manually discharging the generated verification conditions in Coq, and generated executable code based on SANDLog specification and ran the code in simulation. © 2015 Logical Methods in Computer Science.",Declarative networking; Program logic; Routing protocols,Formal logic; Reconfigurable hardware; Routing protocols; Specification languages; Specifications; Theorem proving; Adversarial environments; Automated verification; Declarative networkings; Program logic; Protocol implementation; Secure inter-domain routing; Secure routing protocols; Verification condition; Computer circuits,,,,,"http://www.nsnam.org/; Arnaud, M., Cortier, V., Delaune, S., Modeling and verifying ad hoc routing protocols (2010) Proceedings of CSF; Arnaud, M., Cortier, V., Delaune, S., Deciding security for protocols with recursive tests (2011) Proceedings of CADE; Bau, J., Mitchell, J., A security evaluation of DNSSEC with NSEC3 (2010) Proceedings of NDSS; Bhargavan, K., Obradovic, D., Gunter, C.A., Formal verification of standards for distance vector routing protocols (2002) J.

Despite its promising characteristics, CRNs also introduce new security threats especially the internal attacks during the spectrum sensing process, which can degrade the efficiency of spectrum sensing. To address this issue, this paper proposes a distributed cooperative spectrum sensing strategy (DSCS) based on a dynamic reputation model to defend against attacks and provide reliable spectrum sensing. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate that the proposed DSCS strategy can provide an effective countermeasure against the internal spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attacks through enabling secondary users to obtain more accurate cooperative sensing results in adversarial environments. In addition, the DSCS does not rely on a central authority, nor a common control channel, and are therefore applicable in distributed CRNs. © 2015 IEEE.",Distributed cognitive radio networks; Reputation model;

Detecting a forwarding misbehavior in multi-hop networks is non-trivial because it is hard to filter from node failure or packet collision. This paper proposes a new countermeasure, called camouflage-based active detection, in a rapidly emerging energy harvesting motivated networks (EHNets), where a set of self-sustainable nodes communicate directly or indirectly via multi-hop relays. Four adversarial scenarios motivated by energy harvesting and their potential forwarding vulnerabilities are analyzed. Each node actively disguises itself as an energy harvesting node, monitors any forwarding operation, and detects forwarding misbehaviors of lurk deep malicious nodes in EHNets. Extensive simulation experiments using OMNeT++ show that the proposed approach is highly detection-efficient compared to a hop-by-hop cooperative detection scheme in terms of detection latency and detection rate. © 2015 IEEE.",Camouflage-based active detection; denial-ofservice (DoS); energy harvesting motivated network; selective forwarding attack,Denial-of-service attack; Military communications; Active detection; Cooperative detection; Denial of Service; denial-ofservice (DoS); Extensive simulations; Multihop networks; Packet collisions; Selective forwarding attacks; Energy harvesting,,,,,"Gorlatova, M., Sarik, J., Grebla, G., Cong, M., Kymissis, L., Zussman, G., Movers and shakers: Kinetic energy harvesting for the internet of things (2014) Proc.

Software-defined networking (SDN) is a novel network architectural model - one where the control plane is separated from the data plane by a standardized API - which aims to reduce the network management overhead. However, as the SDN model itself is evolving, its application to multi-tenant virtualized networks raises multiple security challenges. In this paper, we present a security analysis of SDN-based multi-tenant virtualized networks: we outline the security assumptions applicable to such networks, define the relevant adversarial model, identify the main attack vectors for such network infrastructure deployments and finally synthesize a set of high-level security requirements for SDN-based multi-tenant virtualized networks.

Such extracted information could be the identity of suspect authors or their profile attributes such as their gender, age group, ethnicity group, etc. Therefore, when preserving the anonymity of an author is critical, such as that of a whistle blower, it is important to ensure the stylistic anonymity of the conveyed text itself in addition to anonymizing communication channels (e.g. Tor, or the minimization of application fingerprints). Currently, only two stylistic anonymization strategies are known, namely: imitation and obfuscation attacks. A long-term objective is to find automated methods that reliably transform given input texts such that the output texts maximize author anonymity while, reasonably, preserving the semantics of the input texts. Before one proceeds with such long-term objective, it is important to first identify effective strategies that maximize stylistic anonymity. The current state of the literature implies that imitation attacks are better at preserving the anonymity of authors than obfuscation. However, we argue that such evaluations are limited and should not generalize to stylistic anonymity as they were only executed against AA solvers, a closed-set problem. In this study, we extend such evaluations against state-of-the-art AV solvers, an open-set problem. Our results show that imitation attacks degrade the classification accuracy of AV solvers more aggressively than that of AA solvers. We argue that such reduction in accuracy below random chance guessing renders imitation attacks as inferior strategies relative to obfuscation attacks. Furthermore, as we present a general formal notation of stylometry problems, we conjecture that the same observations apply to all stylometry problems (AA, AV, AP, SI). © 2015 IEEE.",Adversarial stylometry; Anonymity; Imitation attacks; Obfuscation attacks; Privacy; Stylometry,Data privacy; Semantics; Anonymity; Automated methods; Classification accuracy; Extraction of information; Formal notations; Imitation attacks; Obfuscation attacks; Stylometry; Network security,,,,,"Stamatatos, E., A survey of modern authorship attribution methods (2009) J.

Meanwhile, the static address configuration of networks and hosts simplifies adversarial reconnaissance for target discovery. Although the randomization of host addresses has been suggested as a proactive disruption mechanism against such reconnaissance, the proposed approaches do not exploit the full potentials of address randomization in provision of unpredictability and attack adaptability. Moreover, these approaches do not provide thorough analysis on effectiveness and limitations of address randomization against relevant threat models, including stealthy scanning and worms. In this paper, we present an effective address randomization technique, called random host address mutation (RHM), that turns end-hosts into untraceable moving targets. This technique achieves maximum efficacy by allowing address randomization to be highly unpredictable and fast, and adaptive to adversarial behavior, while incurring low operational and reconfiguration overhead. Our approach achieves the following objectives: 1) it achieves high uncertainty in adversary scanning by modeling address mutation randomization as a multi-level satisfiability problem; 2) it adapts the mutation scheme by fast characterization of adversarial reconnaissance patterns; 3) it achieves high mutation rate by separating mutation from end-hosts and managing it via network appliances; and 4) it preserves network integrity, manageability and performance by bounding the size of routing tables, preserving end-to-end reachability, and efficient handling of reconfiguration updates. Our extensive analyses and simulation show that the RHM distorts adversarial reconnaissance, slows down (deters) the attack, and increases its detectability. Consequently, the RHM is effective in countering a significant number of sophisticated threat models, including reconnaissance, stealthy/evasive scanning methods, and targeted attacks. We also address limitations of our approach in terms of effectiveness and applicability. © 2015 IEEE.",IP address randomization; Moving Target Defense (MTD); reconnaissance; Scanning,Reconfigurable hardware; Scanning; Uncertainty analysis; Address configuration; IP addresss; Moving target defense; Network reconnaissance; Randomization techniques; Reconfiguration overhead; reconnaissance; Satisfiability problems; Random processes,,,,,"Oliver, S., (2014) MAC Address Randomization Joins Apple's Heap of IOS 8 Privacy Improvements, , http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/06/09/mac-address-randomization-joins-apples-heap-of-ios-8-privacy-improvements, Jun 9 [Online].

While such services are designed to tol- erate crash failures in asynchronous settings, they may not stand up well to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Specif- ically, malicious clients can carefully craft workloads that substantially degrade the performance of many state-of-the- art consensus protocols. By exploiting protocol-specific vul- nerabilities, attackers can constantly force the protocol par- ticipants to slow execution paths [8]. In this paper, we in- vestigate designing consensus protocols that provide accept- able performance under DoS attacks that aim to saturate the bandwidth of protocol participants. We propose a new asynchronous consensus protocol that we call Turtle Consensus. Turtle Consensus employs pre- viously proposed crash-tolerant consensus protocols and ex- ploits their diverse characteristics by switching between pro- tocols from round to round. Some protocols are fast under benign conditions but their performance suffers greatly un- der attack. Other protocols may not be as fast under be- nign conditions, but their performance may actually benefit from naive attacks. By reconfiguring the consensus protocol on-the-fly we can achieve the best of both worlds: excel- lent performance in benign scenarios and acceptable per- formance while under attack, even if the client workload is high. We evaluate Turtle Consensus against adversarial sce- narios where at most one process may fail and show that we can achieve better performance than existing crash-tolerant protocols under attack. © 2015 ACM.",Denial-of-service attacks; Fault-tolerance; Reconfigurable consensus,Computer crime; Fault tolerance; Middleware; Transmission control protocol; Asynchronous consensus; Basic building block; Consensus protocols; Denial of Service; Execution paths; Moving target defense; Reconfigurable; State of the art; Denial-of-service attack,,,,,"Aguilera, M.K., Toueg, S., Randomization and failure detection: A hybrid approach to solve consensus (1996) Proceedings of the 10th International Workshop on Distributed Algorithms, WDAG '96, pp. 29-39. , London, UK, UK, Springer-Verlag; Aura, T., Nikander, P., Leiwo, J., DOS-resistant authentication with client puzzles (2001) Security Protocols, 2133, pp. 170-177. , of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer Berlin Heidelberg; Ben-Or, M., Another advantage of free choice (extended abstract): Completely asynchronous agreement protocols (1983) Proceedings of the Second Annual ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing, PODC '83, pp. 27-30. , New York, NY, USA, ACM; Burrows, M., The Chubby Lock Service for loosely-coupled distributed systems (2006) 7th Symposium on Operating System Design and Implementation, OSDI'06, Seattle, WA, , Nov; Castro, M., Liskov, B., Practical Byzantine fault tolerance (1999) Proceedings of the Third Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation, OSDI '99, pp. 173-186. , Berkeley, CA, USA, USENIX Association; Chandra, T.D., Griesemer, R., Redstone, J., Paxos made live: An engineering perspective (2007) Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth Annual ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing, PODC '07, pp. 398-407. , New York, NY, USA, ACM; Chandra, T.D., Toueg, S., Unreliable failure detectors for reliable distributed systems (1996) J.

Box 3055, Victoria, BC  V8W 3P6, Canada","A number of open cyber-security challenges are arising due to the rapidly evolving scale, complexity, and heterogeneity of modern IT systems and networks. The ease with which copious volumes of operational data can be collected from such systems has produced a strong interest in the use of machine learning (ML) for cyber-security, provided that ML can itself be made sufficiently immune to attack. Adversarial learning (AL) is the domain focusing on such issues and an arising AL theme is the need to ensure that ML solutions make use of robust input measurement features (i.e., the data sets used for ML training must themselves be robust against adversarial influences). This observation leads to further open questions, including: ""What formally denotes sufficient robustness?"", ""Must robust features necessarily exist for all IT systems?"", ""Do robust features necessarily provide complete coverage of the attack space?"", etc. This work shows that these (and other) open AL questions can be usefully re-cast in terms of the classical dynamical system's problem of needing to focus analyses on a system's invariant measures. This re-casting is useful as a large body of mature dynamical systems theory exists concerning invariant measures which can then be applied to cyber-security. To our knowledge this the first work to identify and highlight this potentially useful cross-domain linkage. © 2015 IEEE.",,Aluminum; Artificial intelligence; Complex networks; Dynamical systems; Learning systems;

Existing unpredictability-based privacy models such as unp-privacy, eunp-privacy, unp*-privacy, and unpτ-privacy have captured different kinds of practical attacks, and some of them also have mutual authentication included. However, forward privacy, which allows a tag to remain untraceable even after its corruption, is yet to be well captured in any unpredictability-based privacy models. In this paper, we describe some forward privacy-related attacks that can be launched against RFID tags in practice. We then propose a new unpredictability-based forward privacy model called unpfτ-privacy. It extends an existing one called unpτ-privacy, which has been shown to be stronger than ind-privacy, unp-privacy, and unp*-privacy. We also propose an RFID protocol that supports forward privacy and mutual authentication. We show that it can be proven secure in the unpfτ-privacy model. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Forward privacy; Mutual authentication; RFID; Untraceability,Authentication; Electronic document identification systems;

These models can work well if and only if malicious agents share some common features (i.e., stereotypes) in their profiles and these features can be detected. However, this condition may not hold for all the adversarial scenarios. Smart attackers can show different trustworthiness to different agents and services (i.e., launching context-correlated attacks). In this paper, we propose CAST, a novel Context-Aware Stereotypical Trust deep learning framework. CAST coins a comprehensive set of seven context-aware stereotypes, each of which can capture a unique type of context-correlated attacks, as well as a deep learning architecture to keep the trust stereotyping robust (i.e., resist training errors). The basic idea is to construct a multi-layer perceptive structure to learn the latent correlations between context-aware stereotypes and the trustworthiness, and thus can estimate the new trust by taking into account the context information. We have evaluated CAST using a rich set of experiments over a simulated multi-agent system. The experimental results have successfully confirmed that, our CAST can achieve approximately tens of times higher trust inference accuracy in average than the competing algorithms in the presence of context-correlated attacks, and more importantly can maintain a much better trust inference robustness against stereotyping errors. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Our approach is to secure templates represented as sets using error-correcting codes and Reed-Solomon decoding. To accomplish this, each element in the set is combined with a random codeword and a secret share is computed using the codeword and a Reed-Solomon based secret sharing scheme. These random codewords provide uncertainty for an attacker, while the genuine user can decode to the correct values for verification. Without a reading from the enrolling biometric the shares will appear random, thus protecting the users biometric. We show implementation results for this system on fingerprints using pairs of minutia points. Our system overcomes many common weaknesses for template security systems including replay attacks, malicious servers, eavesdroppers, and record multiplicity attacks. © 2015 Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V.",,Authentication; Biometrics; Codes (symbols); Cryptography; Data privacy; Decoding; Information theory; Biometric authentication; Biometric authentication system; Error correcting code; Minutia points; Privacy preserving; Reed-Solomon decoding; Secret sharing schemes; Template securities; Reed-Solomon codes,,,,,"Dodis, Y., Ostrovsky, R., Reyzin, L., Smith, A., Fuzzy extractors: How to generate strong keys from biometrics and other noisy data (2008) SIAM J.

P2P botnets replace this infrastructure with command channels distributed across the full infected population. Thus, mitigation strongly relies on accurate reconnaissance techniques which map the botnet population. While prior work has studied passive disturbances to reconnaissance accuracy - such as IP churn and NAT gateways -, the same is not true of active antireconnaissance attacks. This work shows that active attacks against crawlers and sensors occur frequently in major P2P botnets. Moreover, we show that current crawlers and sensors in the Sality and Zeus botnets produce easily detectable anomalies, making them prone to such attacks.

Each microgrid is abstracted as a power inverter that can be controlled to regulate its voltage magnitude and phase-angle independently. Moreover, each power inverter is modeled as a single integrator, whose input is given by a voltage droop-control policy that is computed based on voltage magnitude and reactive power injection measurements. Under mild assumptions, we then establish important properties of the nominal linearized closed-loop system, such as stability, positivity, and diagonal dominance. These properties play an important role when characterizing the potential impact of different attack scenarios. In particular, we discuss two attack scenarios where the adversary corrupts measurement data and reference signals received by the voltage droop controllers. The potential impact of instances of each scenario is analyzed using control-theoretic tools, which may be used to develop methodologies for identifying high-risk attack scenarios, as is illustrated by numerical examples. © 2015 IEEE.",Inverters; Microgrids; Power system dynamics; Power system stability; Stability analysis; Voltage control; Voltage measurement,Closed loop systems; Electric inverters; Electric power distribution; Factory automation; Risk perception; Voltage control; Voltage measurement; Diagonal dominance; Linearized closed-loop systems; Micro grid; Power system dynamics; Power system stability; Reactive power injections; Stability analysis; Voltage magnitude; System stability,,,,,"Hatziargyriou, N., Asano, H., Iravani, R., Marnay, C., Microgrids (2007) Power and Energy Magazine, IEEE, 5 (4), pp. 78-94. , July; Shahnia, F., Chandrasena, R.P., Rajakaruna, S., Ghosh, A., Primary control level of parallel distributed energy resources converters in system of multiple interconnected autonomous microgrids within self-healing networks (2014) IET Generation, Transmission & Distribution, 8 (2), pp. 203-222; Andersson, G., Esfahani, P., Vrakopoulou, M., Margellos, K., Lygeros, J., Teixeira, A., Dan, G., Johansson, K., Cyber-security of scada systems (2012) Proc.

We secure templates from adversarial attacks in honest-but-curious server scenarios by utilizing commutative encryption in which the raw fingerprint template is never used in matching or storage. In this system, there is a matching server that performs the enrollment and matching functions on fingerprint data that has been encrypted by a separate encryption server. Since the encrypted template is stored at one server and the encryption key is on another server, an attacker would have to compromise both servers to decrypt the data. Even in this case, the templates are protected by the fuzzy vault scheme. Thus, this scheme limits an attacker's ability to attack active users even after compromising both servers providing multiple layers of template security. © 2015 IEEE.",Decoding; Elliptic curves; Encryption; Polynomials; Servers,Computer vision; Decoding; Digital storage; Polynomials; Servers; Commutative encryption; Elliptic curve; Fingerprint templates; Fingerprint verification; Fuzzy vault scheme; Matching functions; Multiple servers; Template securities; Cryptography,,,,,"Berlekamp, E.R., Welch, L.R., (1986) Error Correction for Algebraic Block Codes, , Dec. 30.

The sharing, and the subsequent analysis of, such data can support a wide range of activities, but concerns around privacy often prompt an organization to transform the data to meet certain protection models (e.g., k-anonymity or ε-differential privacy). These models, however, are based on simplistic adversarial frameworks, which can lead to both under- and over-protection. For instance, such models often assume that an adversary attacks a protected record exactly once. We introduce a principled approach to explicitly model the attack process as a series of steps. Specifically, we engineer a factored Markov decision process (FMDP) to optimally plan an attack from the adversary's perspective and assess the privacy risk accordingly. The FMDP captures the uncertainty in the adversary's belief (e.g., the number of identified individuals that match the de-identified data) and enables the analysis of various real world deterrence mechanisms beyond a traditional protection model, such as a penalty for committing an attack. We present an algorithm to solve the FMDP and illustrate its efficiency by simulating an attack on publicly accessible U.S. census records against a real identified resource of over 500,000 individuals in a voter registry. Our results demonstrate that while traditional privacy models commonly expect an adversary to attack exactly once per record, an optimal attack in our model may involve exploiting none, one, or more individuals in the pool of candidates, depending on context. © 2015 ACM.",Planning; Privacy; Re-identification,Knowledge management; Markov processes; Planning; Risk assessment; Uncertainty analysis; Analysis of various; Differential privacies; Factored Markov decision process; Its efficiencies; Protection models; Publicly accessible; Re identifications; Service provider; Data privacy,,,,,"Bharadwaj, A., El Sawy, O., Pavlou, P., Digital business strategy: Toward a next generation of insights (2013) MIS Quarterly, 37 (2), pp. 471-482; Bonomi, L., Xiong, L., A two-phase algorithm for mining sequential patterns with differential privacy (2013) Proc. 22nd ACM Int'l Conf. on Inform. and Knowl.

An adversarial-aware control scheme, based on sliding mode control using only local sensor information and a decentralized attack detector, is shown to significantly reduce the number and severity of collisions, without the need for inter-vehicle or vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. Simulations demonstrate that collisions are eliminated (or significantly reduced) when the attacker and normal vehicles have same capabilities, and collisions are reduced even with more powerful attackers.",Adaptive cruise control; Attack; Autonomous and automated vehicles; Cooperative adaptive cruise control; Vehicle platoon,Adaptive cruise control; Cruise control; Embedded systems; Sliding mode control; Vehicles; Attack; Automated vehicles; Control schemes; Cooperative adaptive cruise control; Mitigation strategy; Vehicle platoons; Vehicle-to-infrastructure; Vehicular platoons; Vehicle to vehicle communications,,,,,"(2002) The SARTRE Project, , www.sartre-project.net, [Online; accessed 15-June-2015]; Barooah, P., Hespanha, J., Error amplification and disturbance propagation in vehicle strings with decentralized linear control (2005) Decision and Control, 2005 and 2005 European Control Conference.

To achieve this, intrusion detection systems (IDS) may be deployed, which can detect attacks and alert human operators, who can then intervene. However, the resource-constrained nature of many CPS poses a challenge, since reliable IDS can be computationally expensive. Consequently, computational nodes may not be able to perform intrusion detection continuously, which means that we have to devise a schedule for performing intrusion detection. While a uniformly random schedule may be optimal in a purely cyber system, an optimal schedule for protecting CPS must also take into account the physical properties of the system, since the set of adversarial actions and their consequences depend on the physical systems. Here, in the context of water distribution networks, we study IDS scheduling problems in two settings and under the constraints on the available battery supplies. In the first problem, the objective is to design, for a given duration of time T, scheduling schemes for IDS so that the probability of detecting an attack is maximized within that duration. We propose efficient heuristic algorithms for this general problem and evaluate them on various networks. In the second problem, our objective is to design scheduling schemes for IDS so that the overall lifetime of the network is maximized while ensuring that an intruder attack is always detected. Various strategies to deal with this problem are presented and evaluated for various networks.",Cyber-physical system; Dominating sets; Game theory; Intrusion detection systems; Scheduling; Sensor networks,Computation theory; Computer crime; Embedded systems; Game theory; Heuristic algorithms; Mercury (metal); Optimization; Scheduling; Sensor networks; Water distribution systems; Water supply systems; Computational nodes; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Dominating sets; Intrusion Detection Systems; Scheduling problem; Scheduling schemes; Water distribution networks; Intrusion detection,,,,,"Abbas, W., Egerstedt, M., Characterizing heterogeneity in cooperative networks from a resource distribution view-point (2014) Communications in Information and Systems, 14, pp. 1-22; Abbas, W., Egerstedt, M., Liu, C.-H., Thomas, R., Whalen, P., (2014) Deploying Robots with Two Sensors in K f1; 6g-free Graphs, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1308.5450; Abrams, M., Weiss, J., (2008) Malicious Control System Cyber Security Attack Case Study - Maroochy Water Services, Australia, , http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/fisma/ics/documents/Maroochy-Water-Services-Case-Study_report.pdf, Jul; Ahn, N., Park, S., A new mathematical formulation and a heuristic for the maximum disjoint set covers problem to improve the lifetime of the wireless sensor network (2011) Ad Hoc & Sensor Wireless Networks, 13 (3-4), pp. 209-225; Arslan, G., Marden, J.R., Shamma, J.S., Autonomous vehicle-target assignment: A game-theoretical formulation (2007) Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement, and Control, 129 (5), pp. 584-596; Barabàsi, A.-L., Albert, R., Emergence of scaling in random networks (1999) Science, 286 (5439), pp. 509-512. , October; Blume, L.E., The statistical mechanics of strategic interaction (1993) Games and Economic Behavior, 5 (3), pp. 387-424; Brock, W.A., Durlauf, S.N., Discrete choice with social interactions (2001) The Review of Economic Studies, 68 (2), pp. 235-260; Cardei, M., Du, D.-Z., Improving wireless sensor network lifetime through power aware organization (2005) Wireless Networks, 11 (3), pp. 333-340; Deshpande, A., Sarma, S.E., Youcef-Toumi, K., Mekid, S., Optimal coverage of an infrastructure network using sensors with distance-decaying sensing quality (2013) Automatica, 49 (11), pp. 3351-3358; Feige, U., Halldórsson, M.M., Kortsarz, G., Srinivasan, A., Approximating thedomatic number (2002) SIAM Journal on Computing, 32 (1), pp. 172-195; Fujita, S., Yamashita, M., Kameda, T., A study on r-configurations|a resource assignment problem on graphs (2000) SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics, 13 (2), pp. 227-254; Henna, S., Erlebach, T., Approximating maximum disjoint coverage in wireless sensor networks (2013) Ad-hoc, Mobile, and Wireless Network, pp. 148-159. , Springer; Islam, K., Akl, S.G., Meijer, H., Maximizing the lifetime of wireless sensor networks through domatic partition (2009) Local Computer Networks, 2009.

However, in some classification problems, such as spam filtering, a classifier confronts one or many adversaries willing to induce errors in the classifier's judgment on certain kinds of input. In this paper, we consider the problem of finding thrifty strategies for character-based text modification that allow an adversary to revert classifier's verdict on a given family of input texts. We propose three statistical statements of the problem that can be used by an attacker to obtain transformation models which are optimal in some sense. Evaluating these three techniques on a realistic spam corpus, we find that an adversary can transform a spam message (detectable as such by an entropybased text classifier) into a legitimate one by generating and appending, in some cases, as few additional characters as 11% of the original length of the message. © 2015 ACM.",Adversarial machine learning; Compressionbased classifiers; Evasion attacks; Prediction by partial mapping (PPM); Spam filtering; Text classification,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Electronic mail filters; Internet; Learning systems; Automated attacks; Compression-based text classifications; Evasion attacks; Partial mappings; Spam filtering; Text classification; Text classifiers; Transformation model; Text processing,,,,,"Akoglu, L., Chandy, R., Faloutsos, C., Opinion fraud detection in online reviews by network effects (2013) Proceedings of the 7th International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, , AAAI Press; (2005) The SpamAssassin public mail corpus, , https://spamassassin.apache.org/publiccorpus/, Apache SpamAssassin Project.

In this work we address another important security property that has so far received much less attention, namely resilience against denial-of-service attacks that degrade the performance of the network. We formally define resilience and propose a metric for quantifying the resilience of anonymous communication networks (ACNs) against active adversaries. Our metric expresses the degradation in quality of service of an ACN as the decrease in performance resulting from the adversarial removal or disabling of network nodes. We illustrate the practicality of the metric by applying it to a simulated version of the Tor network, and providing an evaluation of the resilience of Tor towards various adversarial strategies. © 2015 ACM.",Anonymous communication networks; Performance; Resilience; Tor,Computer crime; Denial-of-service attack; Network security; Quality of service; Active adversary; Anonymity property; Anonymous communication; Network node; Performance; Resilience; Security properties; Tor networks; Telecommunication networks,,,,,"Albert, R., Jeong, H., Barabasi, A., Error and attack tolerance of complex networks (2000) Nature, 406, pp. 378-382. , 6794; Ball, J., Schneier, B., Greenwald, G., (2013) NSA and GCHQ Target Tor Network that Protects Anonymity of Web Users; Barbera, M.V., Kemerlis, V.P., Pappas, V., Keromytis, A., CellFlood: Attacking tor onion routers on the cheap (2013) ESORICS'13, , September; Borisov, N., Danezis, G., Mittal, P., Tabriz, P., Denial of service or denial of security?

Our design framework encompasses a large number of such coding schemes. Through judicious use of simple cryptographic tools at the core LT-coding level, Falcon codes lend themselves to secure extensions of any LT-based fountain code, in particular providing Raptor codes that achieve resilience to adversarial corruptions while maintaining their fast encoding/decoding times. Falcon codes also come in three variants, each offering different performance trade-offs. For instance, one variant works well with small input messages (100s of KB to 10s of MB), but two other variants are designed to handle much larger messages (several GB). We study Falcon codes in a novel adversarial model for rateless codes over computational (corrupting) channels and prove their security under standard assumptions. We analyze the performance of our new coding schemes through a prototype implementation of their Raptor-code extension and a thorough experimental study that demonstrates their high efficiency in practice. Applied to data transmission, Falcon codes can provably protect Raptor codes against targeted-erasure attacks, which were recently shown by Lopes and Neves [Oakland, 2014] to cause decoding failures of RaptorQ-the most advanced, standardized (IETF RFC6330) rateless code used in practice. Applied to data storage, Falcon codes can provide significant efficiency gainings as drop-in replacements of Reed-Solomon codes; in particular, a 35% speed-up over the state-of-the-art PoR scheme by Shi et al.

Recent research has proposed a variety of defenses with differing security, efficiency, and practicality characteristics. Whereas the majority of these solutions focus on specific code-reuse attack variants such as return-oriented programming (ROP), other attack variants that reuse whole functions, such as the classic return-into-libc, have received much less attention. Mitigating function-level code reuse is highly challenging because one needs to distinguish a legitimate call to a function from an illegitimate one. In fact, the recent counterfeit object-oriented programming (COOP) attack demonstrated that the majority of code-reuse defenses can be bypassed by reusing dynamically bound functions, i.e., functions that are accessed through global offset tables and virtual function tables, respectively. In this paper, we first significantly improve and simplify the COOP attack. Based on a strong adversarial model, we then present the design and implementation of a comprehensive code-reuse defense which is resilient against reuse of dynamically-bound functions. In particular, we introduce two novel defense techniques: (i) a practical technique to randomize the layout of tables containing code pointers resilient to memory disclosure and (ii) booby trap insertion to mitigate the threat of brute-force attacks iterating over the randomized tables. Booby traps serve the dual purpose of preventing fault-analysis side channels and ensuring that each table has sufficiently many possible permutations.

Our model of subversion generalizes previous work in several directions, and is inspired by the proliferation of software attacks (e.g., malware and buffer overflow attacks), and by the recent revelations of Edward Snowden about intelligence agencies trying to surreptitiously sabotage cryptographic algorithms. The main security requirement we put forward demands that a signature scheme should remain unforgeable even in the presence of an attacker applying SAs (within a certain class of allowed attacks) in a fully-adaptive and continuous fashion. Previous notions - e.g., security against algorithm-substitution attacks introduced by Bellare et al. (CRYPTO '14) for symmetric encryption - were non-adaptive and non-continuous. In this vein, we show both positive and negative results for constructing subversion-resilient signature schemes. • Negative results. As our main negative result, we show that a broad class of randomized schemes is unavoidably insecure against SAs, even if using just a single bit of randomness. This improves upon earlier work that was only able to attack schemes with larger randomness space. When designing our attack we consider undetectability to be an explicit adversarial goal, meaning that the end-users (even the ones knowing the signing key) should not be able to detect that the signature scheme was subverted. • Positive results. We complement the above negative results by showing that signature schemes with unique signatures are subversion-resilient against all attacks that meet a basic undetectability requirement. A similar result was shown by Bellare et al. for symmetric encryption, who proved the necessity to rely on stateful schemes; in contrast unique signatures are stateless, and in fact they are among the fastest and most established digital signatures available. We finally show that it is possible to devise signature schemes secure against arbitrary tampering with the computation, by making use of an un-tamperable cryptographic reverse firewall (Mironov and Stephens-Davidowitz, EUROCRYPT '15), i.e., an algorithm that "" sanitizes"" any signature given as input (using only public information). The firewall we design allows to successfully protect so-called re-randomizable signature schemes (which include unique signatures). While our study is mainly theoretical, due to its strong practical motivation, we believe that our results have important implications in practice and might inuence the way digital signature schemes are selected or adopted in standards and protocols. © 2015 ACM.",Digital signatures; Malware; Subversion; Tampering,Authentication; Computer crime; Electronic document identification systems; Malware; Network security; Random processes; Buffer overflow attacks; Cryptographic algorithms; Digital signature schemes; Intelligence agencies; Security requirements; Subversion; Symmetric encryption; Tampering; Cryptography,,,,,"Abdalla, M., Catalano, D., Fiore, D., Verifiable random functions: Relations to identity-based key encapsulation and new constructions (2014) J.

In the literature, schemes for accomplishing this efficiently are called Searchable Encryption (SE). They achieve high efficiency with provable security by means of a quantifiable leakage profile. However, the degree to which SE leakage can be exploited by an adversary is not well understood. To address this, we present a characterization of the leakage profiles of in-the-wild searchable encryption products and SE schemes in the literature, and present attack models based on an adversarial server's prior knowledge. Then we empirically investigate the security of searchable encryption by providing query recovery and plaintext recovery attacks that exploit these leakage profiles. We term these leakage-abuse attacks and demonstrate their effectiveness for varying leakage profiles and levels of server knowledge, for realistic scenarios. Amongst our contributions are realistic active attacks which have not been previously explored. © 2015 ACM.",Leakage; Searchable encryption,Data privacy; Leakage (fluid); Security of data; Active attack; High-efficiency; Plaintext recovery attacks; Prior knowledge; Provable security; Realistic scenario; Search capabilities; Searchable encryptions; Cryptography,,,,,"Enron Email Dataset, , https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/, Accessed: 2015-05-13; Bitglass, Security Compliance, and Encryption, , http://www.bitglass.com/solutions/salesforce-encryption; Cash, D., Jaeger, J., Jarecki, S., Jutla, C.S., Krawczyk, H., Rosu, M.-C., Steiner, M., Dynamic searchable encryption in very-large databases: Data structures and implementation (2014) NDSS 2014, , San Diego, California, USA, Feb. 23-26.

In a model inversion attack, recently introduced in a case study of linear classifiers in personalized medicine by Fredrikson et al. [13], adversarial access to an ML model is abused to learn sensitive genomic information about individuals. Whether model inversion attacks apply to settings outside theirs, however, is unknown. We develop a new class of model inversion attack that exploits confidence values revealed along with predictions. Our new attacks are applicable in a variety of settings, and we explore two in depth: decision trees for lifestyle surveys as used on machine-learning-as-a-service systems and neural networks for facial recognition. In both cases confidence values are revealed to those with the ability to make prediction queries to models. We experimentally show attacks that are able to estimate whether a respondent in a lifestyle survey admitted to cheating on their significant other and, in the other context, show how to recover recognizable images of people's faces given only their name and access to the ML model.

This paper proposed a robust learning method which reduces the influences of attack samples on learning. The sensitivity, defined as the fluctuation of the output with small perturbation of the input, in Localized Generalization Error Model (L-GEM) is measured for each training sample. The classifier's output on attack samples may be sensitive and inaccurate since these samples are different from other untainted samples. An import score is assigned to each sample according to its localized generalization error bound. The classifier is trained using a new training set obtained by resampling the samples according to their importance scores. RBFNN is applied as the classifier in experimental evaluation. The proposed model outperforms than the traditional one under the well-known label flip poisoning attacks including nearest-first and farthest-first flips attack. © 2015 IEEE.",Adversarial Learning; Localized Generalization Error Model (L-GEM); Poisoning Attack; Robust Learning,Classification (of information); Errors; Pattern recognition; Wavelet analysis; Adversarial learning; Experimental evaluation; Localized generalization error models; Localized generalization errors; Performance of classifier; Poisoning attacks; Robust learning; Security application; Learning systems,,,,,"Lowd, D., Meek, C., Good word attacks on statistical spam filters (2005) Second Conference on Email and Anti-Spam (CEAS), , Mountain View, CA, USA; Nelson, B., Barreno, M., Jack Chi, F., Joseph, A.D., Rubinstein, P.B.I., Saini, U., Sutton, C., Xia, K., Misleading learners: Co-opting your spam filter (2009) Machine Learningin Cyber Trust, p. 1751. , Springer US; Newsome, J., Karp, B., Song, D., Paragraph: Thwarting signature learning by training maliciously (2006) Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection, LNCS, pp. 81-105. , Springer; Perdisci, R., Dagon, D., Lee, W., Fogla, P., Sharif, M., Misleadingworm signature generators using deliberate noise injection (2006) Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, SP '06, pp. 17-31. , Washington, DC, USA, , IEEE Computer Society; Moore, D., Shannon, C., Brown, D.J., Voelker, G.M., Savage, S., Inferring internet denial-of-service activity (2006) ACM Trans.

Such information theoretic approaches establish reliable communication and data confidentiality directly at the physical layer of a communication network by taking the properties of the noisy channel into account leading to unconditional security regardless of the computational capabilities of eavesdroppers. The provision of accurate channel state information is a major challenge particularly in wireless communication systems, especially information about the channels to eavesdroppers. In addition, there might be malevolent adversaries who jam or influence the channel of the legitimate users. This paper surveys different models for secure communication under channel uncertainty and adversarial attacks and reviews the corresponding secrecy capacity results, which characterize the maximum rate at which information can be sent to legitimate receivers while being kept perfectly security from eavesdroppers. © 2015 IEEE.",Arbitrarily varying channel; common randomness; compound channel; continuity; robustness; secrecy capacity; wiretap channel,Data communication systems; Information theory; Network layers; Robustness (control systems); Secure communication; Arbitrarily varying channel; Common randomness; Compound channel; continuity; secrecy capacity; Wire-tap channels; Channel state information,,,,,"Shannon, C.E., Communication theory of secrecy systems (1949) Bell Syst.

We present an optimal jamming signal design, which can maximally disrupt the MIMO transmission when the transceiver adopts an anti-jamming mechanism. In particular, signal-to-jamming-plus-noise ratio (SJNR) at the receiver is used as the anti-jamming reliability metric of the legitimate MIMO transmission. The jamming signal design is developed under the most crucial scenario for the jammer where the legitimate transceiver adopt jointly designed maximum-SJNR transmit beamforming and receive filter to suppress/mitigate the disturbance from the jammer. Under this best anti-jamming scheme, we aim to optimize the jamming signal to minimize the receiver's maximum-SJNR under a given jamming power budget. The optimal jamming signal designs are developed in different cases with accordance to the availability of channel state information (CSI) at the jammer. The analytical approximations of the jamming performance in terms of average maximum-SJNR are also provided. Extensive simulation studies confirm our analytical predictions and illustrate the efficiency of the designed optimal jamming signal on disrupting MIMO communications. © 2015 IEEE.",Artificial interference; beamforming; jamming; multiple-inputmultiple-output (MIMO); power allocation; signalto-jamming-plus-noise ratio (SJNR),Availability; Beamforming; Budget control; Channel state information; Design; MIMO systems; Radio transceivers; Security systems; Signal receivers; Transceivers; Wireless telecommunication systems; Analytical approximation; Analytical predictions; Artificial interferences; Extensive simulations; Noise ratio; Power allocations; Transmit beamforming; Wireless communication links; Jamming,,,,,"Poisel, R.A., (2006) Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques, , Boston, MA, USA: Artech House; Basar, T., The Gaussian test channel with an intelligent jammer (1983) IEEE Trans.

Recently, researchers are designed several routing protocols on these networks. However, these routing protocols are more vulnerable to attacks from the intruders, which can easily paralyze the operation of the network due to its inherited characteristics of MANETS. One such type of attack is wormhole attack. Because of its severity, the wormhole attack has attracted a great deal of attention in the research community. This paper compares reactive and proactive routing protocols in adversarial environment. Specifically, wormhole attack is applied to these routing protocols to evaluate its performance through simulation. Comprehensively the results shows the comparative performance of these protocols against wormhole attack is hard to detect and easy to implement. © 2015 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

However, previous research paid little attention on developing general attacking models, which are fundamentals for designing network security mechanisms. In this paper, we approach node compromise attack formalizing problem from an adversarial view and present a general attacking model based on invading virtual backbones of network, which is constructed based on Weakly Connected Dominating Set (WCDS). To investigate the features of our scheme, simulations are conducted to illustrate the influences of infection ratio to network performance.

In contrast to traditional network error correction codes designed for a given network capacity and a given number of errors, we study an arguably more realistic setting that prior knowledge on the network and adversary parameters is not available. For this setting we propose efficient and throughput-optimal error correction schemes, provided that the source and terminals share randomness that is secret form the adversary. We discuss an application of cryptographic pseudorandom generators to efficiently produce the secret randomness, provided that a short key is shared between the source and terminals. Finally we present a secure key distribution scheme for our network setting. © 2015 IEEE.",,Error correction; Errors; Information theory; Network security; Random processes; Cryptographic pseudorandom generators; Network Capacity; Network error correction; Network settings; Reliable Multicast; Resilient networks; Secure key distribution; Throughput-optimal; Network coding,,,,,"Ahlswede, R., Cai, N., Li, S.-Y.R., Yeung, R.W., Network information flow (2000) IEEE Trans.

The present research was conducted in the south of Israel to examine the issue of forgiveness among people currently enmeshed in active and violent conflict. Study 1 was conducted in the Israeli town of Sderot, which for more than a decade has been under frequent rocket fire from neighboring Palestinian Gaza and has also witnessed numerous Israeli retaliatory attacks on Gaza. Study 2 was conducted among residents of towns and communities close to the Gaza border during the 2014 war. We investigated the potential readiness for mutual forgiveness with Gaza residents, apology, and reparation and help to repair war damage. Mutual forgiveness received considerable support, but apology and reparations did not. Perspective-taking vis-à-vis the Palestinians predicted support for mutual forgiveness in the first but not the second study. Acceptance of moral responsibility and dismissal of exonerating cognitions regarding Israel’s conduct in Gaza predicted readiness for apology and reparations. Hence a step towards mutual forgiveness with the adversarial outgroup is feasible under active conflict mainly because it does not involve culpability. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",2014 Gaza War; forgiveness; intergroup conflict; reconciliation,,,,,,"Abu-Nimer, M., Conflict resolution, culture, and religion: Toward a training model of interreligious peacebuilding (2001) Journal of Peace Research, 38, pp. 685-704. , doi; Ablin, J.N., Cohen, H., Clauw, D.J., Shalev, R., Ablin, E., Neumann, L., Buskila, D., A tale of two cities-the effect of low intensity conflict on prevalence and characteristics of musculoskeletal pain and somatic symptoms associated with chronic stress (2009) Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology, 28, pp. S15-S21; Aqeel, M., Al-Ghzawi, K., Khatib, R., Kharma, S., Nawasreh, O., Frequency of post-traumatic stress disorder in children in Gaza strip (2011) Journal of the Royal Medical Services, 18, pp. 52-58; Auerbach, Y., Forgiveness and reconciliation: The religious dimension (2005) Terrorism and Political Violence, 17, pp. 469-485. , doi; Barkan, E., (2001) The guilt of nations: Restitution and negotiating historical injustices, , Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press; Barkan, E., Karn, A., (2006) Taking wrongs seriously: Apologies and reconciliation, , Redwood City, CA: Stanford University Press,, (Eds.).

Can we mimic and measure the effect? We propose a new generative model of network evolution in dynamic and harsh environments. Our model can reproduce the range of topologies observed across known robust and fragile biological networks, as well as several additional transport, communication, and social networks. We also develop a new optimization measure to evaluate robustness based on preserving high connectivity following random or adversarial bursty node loss. Using this measure, we evaluate the robustness of several real-world networks and propose a new distributed algorithm to construct secure networks operating within malicious environments. © 2014, The Author(s).",Biological fragility; Graph models; Network robustness,Biology; Biological fragility; Biological networks; Graph model; Harsh environment; High connectivity; Network robustness; Optimization measures; Real-world networks; Topology,,,,,"Acemoglu, D., Ozdaglar, A., Tahbaz-Salehi, A., Systemic risk and stability in financial networks.

This paper raises the following important question: Are Bloom filters correctly designed in a security context? The answer is no and the reasons are multiple: bad choices of parameters, lack of adversary models and misused hash functions. Indeed, developers truncate cryptographic digests without a second thought on the security implications. This work constructs adversary models for Bloom filters and illustrates attacks on three applications, namely SCRAPY web spider, BITLY DABLOOMS spam filter and SQUID cache proxy. As a general impact, filters are forced to systematically exhibit worst-case behavior. One of the reasons being that Bloom filter parameters are always computed in the average case. We compute the worst-case parameters in adversarial settings, show how to securely and efficiently use cryptographic hash functions and propose several other countermeasures to mitigate our attacks. © 2015 IEEE.",Bloom filters; Denial-of-Service; Digest truncation; Hash functions; Pre-image attack,Application programs; Cryptography; Denial-of-service attack; Hash functions; Proxy caches; Bloom filters; Cryptographic hash functions; Denial of Service; Digest truncation; On-line securities; Pre images; Security implications; Worst-case behaviors; Data structures,,,,,"Bloom, B.H., Space/time trade-offs in hash coding with allowable errors (1970) Commun.

The analysis is sound - a protocol that is deemed private does not leak anything about its private inputs, even if active attacks are performed against it. Privacy against active adversaries is an essential ingredient in constructions aiming to provide security (privacy + correctness) in adversarial models of intermediate (between passive and active) strength. Using our analysis we are able to show that the protocols used by the Sharemind secure multi-party computation platform are actively private. © 2015 IEEE.",active adversary; input privacy; secure computation,Security systems; Active adversary; Active attack; Automatic analysis; Automatic proofs; Secure computation; Secure multi-party computation; Security of data,,,,,"Bogdanov, D., Kamm, L., Laur, S., Pruulmann-Vengerfeldt, P., (2013) Secure Multi-party Data Analysis: End User Validation and Practical Experiments, , http://eprint.iacr.org/, Cryptology ePrint Archive; Goldreich, O., Micali, S., Wigderson, A., How to play any mental game or a completeness theorem for protocols with honest majority (1987) STOC.

Although PRE is inherently more complex than PKE, attack models for PRE have not been developed further than those inherited from PKE. In this paper we address this gap and define a parametric family of attack models for PRE, based on the availability of both the decryption and re-encryption oracles during the security game. This family enables the definition of a set of intermediate security notions for PRE that ranges from ""plain"" IND-CPA to ""full"" IND-CCA. We analyze some relations among these notions of security, and in particular, the separations that arise when the re-encryption oracle leaks re-encryption keys. In addition, we discuss which of these security notions represent meaningful adversarial models for PRE. Finally, we provide an example of a recent ""CCA1-secure"" scheme from PKC 2014 whose security model does not capture chosen-cipher text attacks through re-encryption and for which we describe an attack under a more realistic security notion. This attack emphasizes the fact that PRE schemes that leak re-encryption keys cannot achieve strong security notions. © 2015 IEEE.",Attack models; Proxy Re-Encryption; Security notions,Public key cryptography; Security of data; Security systems; Attack model; Chosen cipher text attack; Parametric family; Proxy re encryptions; Public-key encryption; Security model; Security notion; Strong securities; Cryptography,,,,,"Ajtai, M., Generating hard instances of lattice problems (1996) Proceedings of the Twenty-eighth Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, pp. 99-108. , ACM; Ateniese, G., Benson, K., Hohenberger, S., Key-private proxy reencryption (2009) Topics in Cryptology-CT-RSA 2009, pp. 279-294; Ateniese, G., Fu, K., Green, M., Hohenberger, S., Improved proxy reencryption schemes with applications to secure distributed storage (2006) ACM Transactions on Information and System Security, 9 (1), pp. 1-30; Bellare, M., Desai, A., Pointcheval, D., Rogaway, P., Relations among notions of security for public-key encryption schemes (1998) Advances in Cryptology-CRYPTO'98, pp. 26-45. , Springer; Bellare, M., Hofheinz, D., Kiltz, E., Subtleties in the definition of IND-CCA: When and how should challenge decryption be disallowed?

In this sequential-game model, an attacker first uses limited resources to disable grid components, seeking to maximize second-stage 'total cost.' This value corresponds to a defender who operates the damaged grid to minimize generating and economic load-shedding costs. The defender's problem includes 1) optimal power-flow solutions to represent post-attack operations, 2) optimized replacement of disabled HVTs with quickly installable recovery spares, and 3) longer-term replacements using new procurements. Global Benders decomposition, with a mixed-integer subproblem, solves the AD model; new enumerative techniques help solve the decomposition's master problem and subproblems. Computational tests demonstrate tradeoffs between the number of recovery spares and worst-case total cost, and show how the model could help guide an inventory strategy for recovery spares in an adversarial setting. © 1969-2012 IEEE.",Power system modeling; restoration and protection; security; substations; transformers,Costs; Electric equipment protection; Electric load flow; Electric load shedding; Electric power transmission; Electric substations; Electric transformers; Power transformers; Recovery; Surge protection; Transformer protection; Benders decomposition; Electric power transmission grids; High voltage transformers; Inventory strategies; Optimal power flows; Power system model; Restoration and protection; security; Electric power transmission networks,,,,,"Parfomak, P., Physical security of the U.S. Power grid: High-voltage transformer substations (2014) Congressional Research Service, , Tech.

Though lots of anonymous protocols for secure routing have been proposed, but the proposed solutions happen to be vulnerable at some point. The service rejection attacks or DoS, timing attacks makes both system and protocol vulnerable. This paper studies and discuss about the various existing protocols and how efficient they are in the attacking environment. The protocols such as, ALARM: Anonymous Location-Aided Routing in Suspicious MANET, ARM: Anonymous Routing Protocol for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks, Privacy-Preserving Location-Based On-Demand Routing in MANETs, AO2P: Ad Hoc on-Demand Position-Based Private Routing Protocol, Anonymous Connections. In this paper we propose a new concept by combining two proposed protocols based on geographical location based: ALERT which is based mainly on node-to-node hop encryption and bursty traffic. And Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR), a new geographical location based protocol for wireless networks that uses the router's position and a packet's destination to make forwarding of packets. It follows greedy method of forwarding using the information about the immediate neighboring router in the network. Simulation results have explained the efficiency of the proposed DD-SARP protocol with improved performance when compared to the existing protocols. © 2015 IEEE.",adversarial; ALERT; anonymous; GPSR; Mobile adhoc network; privacy,Ad hoc networks; Data privacy; Internet protocols; Location; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network routing; Routers; Routing protocols; adversarial; ALERT; anonymous; Anonymous communication; Geographical locations; GPSR; Greedy perimeter stateless routing; Location aided routing; Mobile ad hoc networks,,,,,"Defrawy, K.E., Tsudik, G., ALARM: Anonymous location-aided routing in suspicious MANETs (2011) IEEE Trans. on Mobile Computing, 10 (9), pp. 1345-1358. , Sept; Seys, S., Preneel, B., ARM: Anonymous routing protocol for mobile ad hoc networks (2009) Int.

Meanwhile, static configurations of networks and hosts simplify this adversarial reconnaissance. In this paper, we present a novel proactive-adaptive defense technique that turns end-hosts into untraceable moving targets, and establishes dynamics into static systems by monitoring the adversarial behavior and reconfiguring the addresses of network hosts adaptively. This adaptability is achieved by discovering hazardous network ranges and addresses and evacuating network hosts from them quickly. Our approach maximizes adaptability by (1) using fast and accurate hypothesis testing for characterization of adversarial behavior, and (2) achieving a very fast IP randomization (i.e., update) rate through separating randomization from end-hosts and managing it via network appliances. The architecture and protocols of our approach can be transparently deployed on legacy networks, as well as software-defined networks. Our extensive analysis and evaluation show that by adaptive distortion of adversarial reconnaissance, our approach slows down the attack and increases its detectability, thus significantly raising the bar against stealthy scanning, major classes of evasive scanning and worm propagation, as well as targeted (hacking) attacks. © 2015 IEEE.",,Network architecture; Personal computing; Analysis and evaluation; Defense techniques; Hypothesis testing; Legacy networks; Network appliances; Network reconnaissance; Software-defined networks; Worm propagation; Random processes,,,,,"Stafford, S., Li, J., Behavior-based worm detectors compared (2010) RAID, Ser.

The sophistication and resources used in attacks reflect that the attackers may be supported by large organizations and in some cases by foreign governments. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop intelligent cyber defense approaches to better protecting critical cloud infrastructures. In order to have much better protection for critical cloud infrastructures, effective approaches with predictive capability are needed. Much research has been done by applying game theory to generating adversarial models for predictive defense of critical infrastructures. However, these approaches have serious limitations, some of which are due to the assumptions used in these approaches, such as rationality and Nash equilibrium, which may not be valid for current and emerging cloud infrastructures. Another major limitation of these approaches is that they do not capture probabilistic human behaviors accurately, and hence do not incorporate human behaviors. In order to greatly improve the protection of critical cloud infrastructures, it is necessary to predict potential security breaches on critical cloud infrastructures with accurate system-wide causal relationship and probabilistic human behaviors. In this paper, the challenges and our vision on developing such proactive protection approaches are discussed. © 2015 IEEE.",Critical cloud infrastructures; Predictive defense; Pro-active protection;

The popular Tor anonymity network, for instance, is not designed for the former and cannot typically achieve the latter. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of Herd, an anonymity network where a set of dedicated, fully interconnected cloud-based proxies yield suitably low-delay circuits, while untrusted superpeers add scalability. Herd provides caller/callee anonymity among the clients within a trust zone (e.g., jurisdiction) and under a strong adversarial model. Simulations based on a trace of 370 million mobile phone calls among 10.8 million users indicate that Herd achieves anonymity among millions of clients with low bandwidth requirements, and that superpeers decrease the bandwidth and CPU requirements of the trusted infrastructure by an order of magnitude.

The popular Tor anonymity network, for instance, is not designed for the former and cannot typically achieve the latter. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of Herd, an anonymity network where a set of dedicated, fully interconnected cloud-based proxies yield suitably low-delay circuits, while untrusted superpeers add scalability. Herd provides caller/callee anonymity among the clients within a trust zone (e.g., jurisdiction) and under a strong adversarial model. Simulations based on a trace of 370 million mobile phone calls among 10:8 million users indicate that Herd achieves anonymity among millions of clients with low bandwidth requirements, and that superpeers decrease the bandwidth and CPU requirements of the trusted infrastructure by an order of magnitude. Finally, experiments using a prototype deployment on Amazon EC2 show that Herd has a delay low enough for high-quality calls in most cases. © 2015 ACM.",Anonymity networks; Intersection attacks; Strong anonymity; Voice-over-IP,Bandwidth; Convolutional codes; Delay circuits; Internet telephony; Networks (circuits); Voice/data communication systems; Anonymity networks; Experimental evaluation; Intersection attacks; Mobile phone calls; Prototype deployment; Strong anonymity; Traffic analysis; Voice over IP; Quality control,,,,,"A Potential Technique to Deanonymise Users of the TOR Network, , http://www.spiegel.de/media/media-35538.pdf; Amazon Web Services Simple Monthly Calculator, , http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html; Hide My Ass, , http://blog.hidemyass.com/2011/09/23/lulzsec-fiasco; Inside TAO: Documents Reveal Top NSA Hacking Unit, , http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/the-nsa-usespowerful-toolbox-in-effort-to-spy-on-global-networks-a-940969.html; International Telecommunication Union (ITU), , http://www.itu.int/; Jitsi, , http://www.jitsi.org; Microsoft Releases 2013 Law Enforcement Requests Report, , http://www.microsoft.com/about/corporatecitizenship/enus/reporting/transparency; NSA and GCHQ Target Tor Network that Protects Anonymity of Web Users, , http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/nsa-gchq-attack-tor-network-encryption; NSA Collecting Phone Records of Millions of Verizon Customers Daily, , http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order; NSA Prism Program Taps in to User Data of Apple, Google and Others, , http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data; Obfsproxy, , https://www.torproject.org/projects/obfsproxy.html.en; Silent Circle, , https://silentcircle.com; User's Guide for PRISM Skype Collection, , http://www.spiegel.de/media/media-35530.pdf; (2012) Skype is a Useful and Increasingly Dangerous Tool, , http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/01/world/middleeast/syrian-rebels-turn-to-skype-for-\\communications.html, For Syria's Rebel Movement; (2012) TOR Fone, , http://www.torfone.org; (2013) Creating a Low-latency Calling Network, , http://www.whispersystems.org/blog/low-latency-switching; (2013) The Future of the Internet: Balkanization and Borders, , http://ideas.time.com/2013/10/11/the-future-of-the-internet-\\balkanization-and-borders; (2014) Freedom on the Net 2014, , https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/freedom-net-2014; (2015) Herd Source Code and Specifications, , https://aqua.mpi-sws.org; Back, A., Goldberg, I., Shostack, A., Freedom systems 2.1 security issues and analysis (2001) White Paper, Zero Knowledge Systems, Inc, , May; Berthold, O., Federrath, H., Köpsell, S., Web mixes: A system for anonymous and unobservable internet access (2000) PET; Berthold, O., Pfitzmann, A., Standtke, R., The disadvantages of free mix routes and how to overcome them (2001) Workshop on Designing Privacy Enhancing Technologies; Cha, M., Haddadi, H., Benevenuto, F., Gummadi, K.P., Measuring user influence in twitter: The million follower fallacy (2010) ICWSM; Chaum, D., Untraceable electronic mail, return addresses, and digital pseudonyms (1981) CACM, 24 (2). , Feb; Cole, R.G., Rosenbluth, J.H., Voice over IP performance monitoring (2001) Proc. of SIGCOMM CCR, , Apr; Danezis, G., Diaz, C., Troncoso, C., Laurie, B., Drac: An architecture for anonymous low-volume communications (2010) PET; Danezis, G., Dingledine, R., Mathewson, N., Mixminion: Design of a type III anonymous remailer protocol (2003) Proc. of IEEE S&P, , May; Dingledine, R., Mathewson, N., Syverson, P., Tor: The second-generation onion router (2004) Proc. of USENIX Security Symposium, , August; Anatomy of Facebook, , https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-data-team/anatomy-of-facebook/10150388519243859, Facebook; Freedman, M.J., Morris, R., Tarzan: A peer-to-peer anonymizing network layer (2002) CCS; Gabielkov, M., Rao, A., Legout, A., Studying social networks at scale: Macroscopic anatomy of the twitter social graph (2014) Proc. of SIGMETRICS; Gülc, C., Tsudik, G., Mixing e-mail with babel (1996) Proc. of NDSS; Hsiao, H.-C., Kim, T.H.-J., Perrig, A., Yamada, A., Nelson, S.C., Gruteser, M., Meng, W., Lap: Lightweight anonymity and privacy (2012) IEEE Security and Privacy; (1998) A Computational Model for Use in Transmission Planning, , ITU-T.

State-of-the-art protocols mostly rely on distributed hash tables (DHTs) in order to enable user-to-user communication. They are thus unable to provide transport address privacy and guaranteed low path stretch while ensuring sub-linear routing state together with tolerance of insider adversaries. In this paper we present U-Sphere, a novel location-independent routing protocol that is tolerant to Sybil adversaries and achieves low O(1) path stretch while maintaining Õ(√n) per-node state. Departing from DHT designs, we use a landmark-based construction with node color groupings to aid flat name resolution while maintaining the stretch and state bounds. We completely remove the need for landmark-based location directories and build a name-record dissemination overlay that is able to better tolerate adversarial attacks under the assumption of social trust links established between nodes. We use large-scale emulation on both synthetic and actual network topologies to show that the protocol successfully achieves the scalability goals in addition to mitigating the impact of adversarial attacks. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Compact routing; Decentralized networks; Privacy; Security,Data privacy; Electric network topology; Navigation; Compact routing; Decentralized networks; Distributed hash tables; Location independent; Peer-to-peer communications; Security; State-of-the art protocols; User-to-user communication; Network routing,,,,,"Baumgart, I., Hartmann, F., Towards secure user-centric networking: Service-oriented and decentralized social networks 2011 Fifth IEEE Conference on Self-adaptive and Self-organizing Systems Workshops (SASOW), 2011, pp. 3-8; Cutillo, L., Molva, R., Strufe, T., Safebook: A privacy-preserving online social network leveraging on real-life trust (2009) IEEE Commun.

Reduced throughput and increased delay could violate the real-time constraints of cyber-physical systems. In a flow redirection attack, an adversary jams a set of network links in order to cause network sources to divert traffic to links that are controlled by the adversary, enabling higher-layer attacks. In this paper, we introduce a passivity approach for modeling the flow redirection attack. Using our approach, we identify a class of dynamic jamming strategies for flow redirection, in which the adversary updates the probability of jamming based on the rate of flow traversing the link. We provide sufficient conditions for feasibility of the jamming strategies for energy-constrained adversaries, and develop an efficient algorithm for deriving an optimal jamming strategy for a given network and desired flow allocation. Our results are illustrated via a numerical study. © 2015 American Automatic Control Council.",,Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Real time systems; Signal receivers; Control of networks; Energy-constrained; Flow allocations; Interfering signals; Jamming attacks; Jamming strategies; Passivity approach; Real time constraints; Jamming,,,,,"Hadley, M., McBride, J., Edgar, T., ONeil, L., Johnson, J., (2007) Securing Wide Area Measurement Systems, , US Department of Energy; Poisel, R., (2011) Modern Communications Jamming: Principles and Techniques, , Artech House; Kelly, F., Voice, T., Stability of end-to-end algorithms for joint routing and rate control (2005) ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review, 35 (2), pp. 5-12; Lazos, L., Liu, S., Krunz, M., Mitigating control-channel jamming attacks in multi-channel ad hoc networks (2009) Second ACM Conference on Wireless Network Security, pp. 169-180; Bayraktaroglu, E., King, C., Liu, X., Noubir, G., Rajaraman, R., Thapa, B., Performance of IEEE 802.11 under jamming (2013) Mobile Networks and Applications, 18 (5), pp. 678-696; Karlof, C., Wagner, D., Secure routing in wireless sensor networks: Attacks and countermeasures (2003) Ad Hoc Networks, 1 (2), pp. 293-315; Kang, K.-D., Son, S.H., Real-time data services for cyber physical systems (2008) IEEE Distributed Computing Systems Workshops, pp. 483-488; Xu, W., Trappe, W., Zhang, Y., Wood, T., The feasibility of launching and detecting jamming attacks in wireless networks (2005) International Symposium on Mobile Ad Hoc Networking and Computing, pp. 46-57; Tague, P., Slater, D., Poovendran, R., Noubir, G., Linear programming models for jamming attacks on network traffic flows (2008) International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks and Workshops, pp. 207-216; Bhattacharya, S., Başar, T., Game-theoretic analysis of an aerial jamming attack on a UAV communication network (2010) American Control Conference (ACC), pp. 818-823; Pasqualetti, F., Dorfler, F., Bullo, F., Attack detection and identification in cyber-physical systems (2013) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 58 (11), pp. 2715-2729; Langbort, C., Ugrinovskii, V., (2012) One-shot Control Over an Avc-like Adversarial Channel, pp. 3528-3533; Wen, J.T., Arcak, M., A unifying passivity framework for network flow control (2004) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 49 (2), pp. 162-174; Sztipanovits, J., Koutsoukos, X., Karsai, G., Kottenstette, N., Antsaklis, P., Gupta, V., Goodwine, B., Wang, S., Toward a science of cyber-physical system integration (2012) Proceedings of the IEEE, 100 (1), pp. 29-44; Lee, P., Clark, A., Bushnell, L., Poovendran, R., A passivity framework for modeling and mitigating wormhole attacks on networked control systems (2014) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 59 (12), pp. 3224-3237; Ngai, E.-H., Liu, J., Lyu, M.R., On the intruder detection for sinkhole attack in wireless sensor networks (2006) IEEE International Conference on Communications, 8, pp. 3383-3389; Brogliato, B., Egeland, O., Lozano, R., Maschke, B., (2007) Dissipative Systems Analysis and Control: Theory and Applications, , Springer; Khalil, H.K., (2002) Nonlinear Systems, , Prentice Hall Upper Saddle River; Studer, A., Perrig, A., The coremelt attack (2009) Computer Security - Esorics, pp. 37-52. , Springer",,,American Automatic Control Council (AACC),Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2015 American Control Conference, ACC 2015",1 July 2015 through 3 July 2015,,113893,7431619,9.78148E+12,PRACE,,English,Proc Am Control Conf,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940931829

To characterize the resilience of a system against such sensor attacks, we introduce a new notion of observability - termed ""observability under attacks"" - that addresses the question of whether or not it is possible to uniquely reconstruct the state of the system by observing its inputs and outputs over a period of time, with the understanding that some of the available system's outputs may have been corrupted by the opponent. We provide computationally efficient tests for observability under attacks that amount to testing the (standard) observability for an appropriate finite set of systems. In addition, we propose two state estimation algorithms that permit the state reconstruction in spite of the attacks. One of these algorithms uses observability Gramians and a finite window of measurements to reconstruct the initial state. The second algorithm takes the form of a switched observer that asymptotically converges to the correct state estimate in the absence of additive noise and disturbances, or to a neighborhood of the correct state estimate in the presence of bounded noise and disturbances. © 2015 American Automatic Control Council.",,Additive noise; Additives; Continuous time systems; Linear systems; State estimation; Bounded noise; Computationally efficient; Continuous-time linear systems; Initial state; Multi-output; Observability gramians; State estimates; State reconstruction; Observability,,,,,"Amin, S., Cárdenas, A.A., Sastry, S.S., Safe and secure networked control systems under denial-of-service attacks (2009) Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control, pp. 31-45. , Springer; Fawzi, H., Tabuada, P., Diggavi, S., Secure estimation and control for cyber-physical systems under adversarial attacks (2014) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 59 (6), pp. 1454-1467. , June; Hendrickx, J.M., Johansson, K.H., Jungers, R.M., Sandberg, H., Sou, K.C., Efficient computations of a security index for false data attacks in power networks (2014) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 59 (12), pp. 3194-3208. , December; Hespanha, J.P., (2009) Linear Systems Theory, , Princeton University Press; Jones, M., Kotsalis, G., Shamma, J.S., Cyber-attack forecast modeling and complexity reduction using a game-theoretic framework (2013) Control of Cyber-Physical Systems, pp. 65-84. , Springer; Liu, Y., Ning, P., Reiter, M.K., False data injection attacks against state estimation in electric power grids (2011) ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC), 14 (1), p. 13; Manshaei, M.H., Zhu, Q., Alpcan, T., Basar, T., Hubaux, J., Game theory meets network security and privacy (2013) ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 45 (3), p. 25; Massoumnia, M.A., Verghese, G.C., Willsky, A.S., Failure detection and identification (1989) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 34 (3), pp. 316-321. , March; Mo, Y., Hespanha, J.P., Sinopoli, B., Resilient detection in the presence of integrity attacks (2014) IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 62 (1), pp. 31-43. , January; Pasqualetti, F., Dorfler, F., Bullo, F., Attack detection and identification in cyber-physical systems (2013) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 58 (11), pp. 2715-2729. , November; Shoukry, Y., Tabuada, P., Event-triggered projected luenberger observer for linear systems under sparse sensor attacks (2014) Proccedings of the 53rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC); Sontag, E.D., Input to state stability: Basic concepts and results (2008) Nonlinear and Optimal Control Theory, 1932, pp. 163-220; Teixeira, A., Amin, S., Sandberg, H., Johansson, K.H., Sastry, S.S., Cyber security analysis of state estimators in electric power systems (2010) Proccedings of the 49th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC), pp. 5991-5998; Teixeira, A., Shames, I., Sandberg, H., Johansson, K.H., A secure control framework for resource-limited adversaries (2015) Automatica, 51, pp. 135-148. , January",,,American Automatic Control Council (AACC),Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2015 American Control Conference, ACC 2015",1 July 2015 through 3 July 2015,,113893,7431619,9.78148E+12,PRACE,,English,Proc Am Control Conf,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940913259

Intelligent and adaptive attackers may indeed exploit specific vulnerabilities exposed by machine learning techniques to violate system security. Being robust to adversarial data manipulation is thus an important, additional requirement for machine learning algorithms to successfully operate in adversarial settings. In this work, we evaluate the security of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to well-crafted, adversarial label noise attacks. In particular, we consider an attacker that aims to maximize the SVM's classification error by flipping a number of labels in the training data. We formalize a corresponding optimal attack strategy, and solve it by means of heuristic approaches to keep the computational complexity tractable. We report an extensive experimental analysis on the effectiveness of the considered attacks against linear and non-linear SVMs, both on synthetic and real-world datasets. We finally argue that our approach can also provide useful insights for developing more secure SVM learning algorithms, and also novel techniques in a number of related research areas, such as semi-supervised and active learning. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Adversarial learning; Label flip attacks; Label noise; Support vector machines,Classification (of information); Heuristic methods; Learning systems; Malware; Semi-supervised learning; Support vector machines; Adversarial learning; Classification errors; Experimental analysis; Machine learning techniques; Optimal attack strategies; Real-world datasets; Security properties; Support vector machine (SVMs); Learning algorithms; adversarial label noise; algorithm; analysis; Article; attack algorithm; classification algorithm; classification error; classifier; correlation analysis; error; extensive experimental analysis; gradient ascent algorithm; hyperplane tilting; hypothesis; learning algorithm; noise; priority journal; statistical parameters; support vector machine,,,,,"Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., Can machine learning be secure?

In this paper we explore and evaluate a new approach to learning with label noise in intrinsically high-dimensional data, based on using neighbor occurrence models for hubness-aware k-nearest neighbor classification. Hubness is an important aspect of the curse of dimensionality that has a negative effect on many types of similarity-based learning methods. As we will show, the emergence of hubs as centers of influence in high-dimensional data affects the learning process in the presence of label noise. We evaluate the potential impact of hub-centered noise by defining a hubness-proportional random label noise model that is shown to induce a significantly higher kNN misclassification rate than the uniform random label noise. Real-world examples are discussed where hubness-correlated noise arises either naturally or as a consequence of an adversarial attack. Our experimental evaluation reveals that hubness-based fuzzy k-nearest neighbor classification and Naive Hubness-Bayesian k-nearest neighbor classification might be suitable for learning under label noise in intrinsically high-dimensional data, as they exhibit robustness to high levels of random label noise and hubness-proportional random label noise. The results demonstrate promising performance across several data domains. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Classification; High-dimensional data; Hubness; K-nearest neighbor; Label noise; Neighbor occurrence models,Clustering algorithms; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Experimental evaluation; Fuzzy k nearest neighbor (FKNN); High dimensional data; Hubness; K-nearest neighbor classification; K-nearest neighbors; Misclassification rates; Occurrence model; Classification (of information); accuracy; Article; calculation; fuzzy system; k nearest neighbor; learning algorithm; mathematical analysis; priority journal; probability,,,,,"Almeida, T.A., Hidalgo, J.M.G., Yamakami, A., Contributions to the study of sms spam filtering: new collection and results (2011) Proceedings of the 11th ACM Symposium on Document Engineering, pp. 259-262. , DocEng [U+05F3]11, ACM, New York, NY, USA; Angluin, D., Laird, P., Learning from noisy examples (1988) Mach.

Cyber space is particularly vulnerable to unforeseen attacks, as most computer networks have a large, complex, opaque attack surface area and are therefore extremely difficult to analyze. Abstract adversarial models which capture the pertinent features needed for analysis, can reduce the complexity sufficiently to make analysis feasible. Game theory allows for mathematical analysis of adversarial models; however, its scalability limitations restrict its use to simple, abstract models. Computational game theory is focused on scaling classical game theory to large, complex systems capable of modeling real-world environments; one promising approach is coevolution where each player's fitness is dependent on its adversaries. In this paper, we propose the Coevolutionary Agent-based Network Defense Lightweight Event System (CANDLES), a framework designed to coevolve attacker and defender agent strategies and evaluate potential solutions with a custom, abstract computer network defense simulation. By performing a qualitative analysis of the result data, we provide a proof of concept for the applicability of coevolution in planning for, and defending against, novel attacker strategies in computer network security. © 2015 ACM.",Coevolution; Cyber security; Simulation,Complex networks; Computer networks; Computer software; Network security; Classical game theory; Co-evolution; Computational game theories; Cyber security; Mathematical analysis; Qualitative analysis; Real world environments; Simulation; Game theory,,,,,"Arnold, H., Masad, D., Pagani, G.A., Schmidt, J., Stepanova, E., NetAttack: Co-evolution of network and attacker (2013) Proceedings of the Santa Fe Institute Complex Systems Summer School; Benzel, T., Braden, B., Faber, T., Mirkovic, J., Schwab, S., Sollins, K., Wroclawski, J., Current developments in DETER cybersecurity testbed technology (2009) Proceedings of the Cybersecurity Applications & Technology Conference for Homeland Security (CATCH), pp. 57-70. , IEEE; Cliff, D., Miller, G.F., Tracking the red queen: Measurements of adaptive progress in co-evolutionary simulations (1995) Advances in Artificial Life, pp. 200-218. , Springer; Colbaugh, R., Glass, K., Leveraging sociological models for prediction i: Inferring adversarial relationships (2012) 2012 IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI), pp. 66-71. , IEEE; Colbaugh, R., Glass, K., Predictability-oriented defense against adaptive adversaries (2012) 2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC), pp. 2721-2727; Grana, J., Wolpert, D., Neil, J., Xie, D., Bhattacharya, T., Bent, R., HMMs for Optimal Detection of Cybernet Attacks, , Technical Report SFI-2014-06-022, Santa Fe Institute, June 2014; Hingorani, N.G., Gyugyi, L., El-Hawary, M., (1999) Understanding FACTS: Concepts and Technology of Flexible AC Transmission Systems, , Wiley-IEEE Press, Dec; Phillips, A.T., (2012) Now Hear This-The Asymmetric Nature of Cyber Warfare, , US Naval Institute, volume 138/10/1, 316, Oct; Pridmore, L., Lardieri, P., Hollister, R., National Cyber Range (NCR) automated test tools: Implications and application to network-centric support tools (2010) Proceedings of the 2010 IEEE Systems Readiness Technology Conference (AUTOTESTCON), pp. 1-4. , Sept; Service, T., Tauritz, D., Increasing infrastructure resilience through competitive coevolution (2009) New Mathematics and Natural Computation, 5 (2), pp. 441-457. , July; Van Dijk, M., Juels, A., Oprea, A., Rivest, R.L., FlipIt: The game of ""stealthy takeover"" (2013) Journal of Cryptology, 26 (4), pp. 655-713; Yan, G., Lee, R., Kent, A., Wolpert, D., Towards a Bayesian network game framework for evaluating DDoS attacks and defense (2012) Proceedings of the 2012 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS '12), pp. 553-566",,Silva S.,ACM SIGEVO,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","17th Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, GECCO 2015",11 July 2015 through 15 July 2015,,118007,,9.78145E+12,,,English,GECCO - Companion Publ.

Applying physical layer secrecy approaches will enable the exchange of confidential messages over a wireless medium in the presence of unauthorized eavesdroppers, without using any secret keys. However, physical layer security approaches are typically feasible only when the source-eavesdropper channel is weaker than the source-destination channel. Cooperative jamming can be used to overcome this challenge and increase the secrecy rate. In this paper, the security of two-phase relaying system with multiple intermediate nodes and in the presence of an eavesdropper is investigated. To enhance the system secrecy rate, a joint cooperative beamforming and jamming combined with relay and jammer selections is proposed. In phase I, the source node broadcasts a signal to relays while three intermediate nodes (which act as jammers) help the source node by transmitting random jamming signals to confuse the eavesdropper. Since the friendly (cooperative) jammers create interference for both the intended relays and the eavesdropper, optimal beamforming is applied such that no interference is caused at two preselected desired relays (that are going to receive the confidential massage in phase I). In phase II, two preselected relays transmit the source message with beamforming coefficients such that the received signal at the eavesdropper is completely nulled out. Our goal in this paper is to minimize the received SNR at the eavesdropper while increasing it at the destination as much as possible by applying different methods such as cooperative beamforming, cooperative jamming and relay selection. To avoid operational complexity, we consider the minimum number of intermediate nodes that are necessary without losing the performance. Numerical results demonstrate the advantage of our proposed scheme compared with the scheme with no cooperative jamming. © 2015 IEEE.",Beamforming; Cooperative jamming; Physical layer security; Relay selection,Beamforming; Network layers; Signal to noise ratio; Wireless telecommunication systems; Confidential message; Cooperative beamforming; Cooperative jamming; Operational complexity; Physical layer security; Physical-layer secrecies; Relay selection; Wireless communications; Jamming,,,,,"Wyner, A.D., The wire-tap channel (1975) Bell System Technical Journal, the, 54 (8), pp. 1355-1387; Leung-Yan-Cheong, S., Hellman, M.E., The Gaussian wire-tap channel (1978) IEEE Trans.

Numerous solutions have been proposed, yet most of them are shortly found either unable to satisfy some critical security requirements or short of a few important features. To overcome this unsatisfactory situation, researchers often work around it in hopes of a new proposal (but no one has succeeded so far), while paying little attention to the fundamental question: whether or not there are inherent limitations that prevent us from designing an ""ideal"" scheme that satisfies all the desirable goals? In this work, we aim to provide a definite answer to this question. We first revisit two foremost proposals, i.e. Tsai et al.'s scheme and Li's scheme, revealing some subtleties and challenges in designing such schemes. Then, we systematically explore the inherent conflicts and unavoidable trade-offs among the design criteria. Our results indicate that, under the current widely accepted adversarial model, certain goals are beyond attainment. This also suggests a negative answer to the open problem left by Huang et al. in 2014. To the best of knowledge, the present study makes the first step towards understanding the underlying evaluation metric for anonymous two-factor authentication, which we believe will facilitate better design of anonymous two-factor protocols that offer acceptable trade-offs among usability, security and privacy. © 2014 IEEE.",de-synchronization attack; offline dictionary attack; smart card loss attack; Two-factor authentication; user anonymity,Commerce; Computer crime; Cryptography; Economic and social effects; Network security; Smart cards; De-synchronization attacks; Distributed systems; Inherent limitations; Off-line dictionary attacks; Security and privacy; Security requirements; Two factor authentication; User anonymity; Authentication,,,,,"Bond, M., Choudary, O., Murdoch, S., Chip and skim: Cloning EMV cards with the pre-play attack (2014) Proc.

A typical wind farm consists of a relatively large number of turbines under some form of decentralized control. In this context, a cyber-attack to wind power infrastructure may not only cause immediate physical damage to the facility in question, but may also threaten the stability of the power system in which this facility operates. In this paper, we present a novel distributed algorithm aimed at detecting cyber-attacks in a wind farm. The cyber-attacks considered take the form of adversarial manipulation of different turbine-specific control logic parameters. The proposed algorithm relies on the operational dynamics specific to wind farms namely that turbines that are relatively close are subject to similar wind patterns and hence must be in similar control ""states"" most of the time. This can be seen as a ""wisdom of the crowd"" effect: the ""true"" state is the state of the majority of turbines in physical proximity when only a few have been compromised. In the proposed algorithm, each turbine in the farm periodically shares information regarding their own control ""state"" with neighboring turbines through a dedicated wireless channel. We test the performance of the proposed algorithm in a simulation test-bed based on Denmark's Horns Rev wind farm. The results indicate that iterative reputation or trust re-allocation enables a distributed identification of affected turbines under a wide array of cyber-attack scenarios. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",cyber-security; distributed systems; intrusion detection system; system-aware cyber-security; wind farm,Crime; Decentralized control; Distributed database systems; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Intrusion detection; Iterative methods; Network security; Systems engineering; Turbines; Wind power; Cyber security; Distributed identification; Distributed systems; Intrusion Detection Systems; Simulation test beds; Wind farm; Wind power infrastructures; Wisdom of the crowds; Computer crime,,,,,"Christiansen, M.B., (2006) Wind Energy Applications of Synthetic Aperture Radar, Risø National Laboratory, 105. , Roskilde, Denmark; Consenza, G., Pineda, M., Parravano, A., Emergence of patterns in driven and in autonomous spatiotemporal systems (2003) Phys Rev e, 67; García-Sanz, M., Houpis, C.H., (2012) Wind Energy Systems: Control Engineering Design, , CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL; Hann, A., Manimaran, G., Sauer, P., Cyber-physical systems security for smart grid (2012) Power Systems Engineering Research Center Publication White Paper, , February 2; Hasager, C., Rasmussen, L., Peña, A., Jensen, L., Réthoré, P.-E., Wind farm wake: The Horns Rev photo case (2013) Energies, 6 (2), pp. 696-716; Yan, J., Liu, C.-C., Govindarasu, M., (2011) Power Systems Conference and Exposition (PSCE), 2011 IEEE/PES, pp. 1-6; Jones, R.A., Horowitz, B., A system-aware cyber security architecture (2012) Syst Eng, 15 (2), pp. 225-240; Manwell, J.F., (2002) Wind Energy Explained: Theory, Design and Application, , Wiley, Chichester, NY; Moya, J.M., Araujo, Á., Bankovic, Z., De Goyeneche, J.-M., Vallejo, J.C., Malagõn, P., Villanueva, D., Blesa, J., Improving security for SCADA sensor networks with reputation systems and self-organizing maps (2009) Sensors, 9 (11), pp. 9380-9397; Ouchi, B., Kaneko, K., Coupled maps with local and global interactions (2000) Chaos: Interdisc J Nonlinear Sci, 10, pp. 359-365; Pao, L.Y., Johnson, K.E., A tutorial on the dynamics and control of wind turbines and wind farms (2009) American Control Conference, ACC'09, pp. 2076-2089. , Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

This is not necessarily descriptive of terrorist behavior in real-world contexts. Terrorists often exhibit a type of strategy-induced substitution or behavior referred to as transference. Modified prospect theory decision weights are proposed to model transference. To account for the defender's incomplete information, terrorists' target choice probabilities are modeled with a logit distribution using endogenously determined decision weights. The strategic logit risk analysis (SLRA) method is developed as a framework for integrating the two behavioral models. It accounts for the feedback loop between the allocation of defensive resources and attack probabilities characteristic of adversarial dynamics. For the resource-allocation optimization problem, SLRA provides a link between traditional safety probabilistic risk analysis (PRA) and game-theoretic models. A simple but realistic example consisting of three potential targets is used to explore the impact of the proposed behavioral models and differences between minmax, Nash equilibrium, traditional safety PRA, and SLRA strategies. There are profound differences between these models with significant impact on the allocation of counterterrorism defensive resources. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",counterterrorism; game theory; logit distribution; probabilistic risk analysis; strategic terrorists; transference,Behavioral research; Decision theory; Probability distributions; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Safety engineering; Systems engineering; Terrorism; Counter terrorism; logit distribution; Probabilistic risk analysis; strategic terrorists; transference; Game theory,,,,,"Aumann, R.J., Maschler, M., Some thoughts on the minmax principle (1972) Manage Sci, 18 (5), pp. 54-63; Barros, C.P., Proença, I., Mixed logit estimation of radical Islamic terrorism in Europe and North America: A comparative study (2005) J Conflict Res, 49, pp. 298-314; Basar, T., Olsder, G.J., (1995) Dynamic Noncooperative Game Theory, , 2nd edition, Academic Press, San Diego; Bernheim, B.D., Rationalizable strategic behavior (1984) Econometrica, 52 (4), pp. 1007-1028; Bier, V.M., Haphuriwat, N., Menoyo, J., Zimmerman, R., Culpen, A.M., Optimal resource allocation for defense of targets based on different measures of attractiveness (2008) Risk Anal, 28 (3), pp. 763-767; Brown, G.G., Cox, L.A., Jr., How probabilistic risk assessment can mislead terrorism analysts (2011) Risk Anal, 31 (2), pp. 196-204; Brown, G.G., Cox, L.A., Jr., Making terrorism risk analysis less harmful and more useful: Another try (2011) Risk Anal, 31 (2), pp. 193-195; Cromwell, J., Drozd, E.M., (2008) A Target-based Model of Efficient Allocation of Federal Resources to the States for Emergency Preparedness, , http://www.rti.org/pubs/op-0001-0802-cromwell.pdf, Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC, accessed August 4, 2014; Dutta, P.K., (1999) Strategies and Games: Theory and Practice, , MIT Press, Cambridge; Einstein, A., (1954) Ideas and Opinions, , Bonanza Books, New York; Ellsberg, D., Theory of the reluctant duelist (1956) Am Econ Rev, 46 (5), pp. 909-923; Enders, W., Sandler, T., (2012) The Political Economy of Terrorism, , 2nd edition, Cambridge University Press, New York; Fricker, R.D., Jr., Game theory in an age of terrorism: How can statistician contribute?

In such networks, adversary may maliciously modify some edge-flows, and legitimate users should resort to network error correction strategies to transmit data reliably. Unlike prior papers, which focused on the capacities of the networks, we consider the expense of resources used by the flow. Hereby, this paper uses an optimization problem to define the concept of minimum cost network error correction flows. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition of feasibility of the allocation problem, and derive a cut-set outer bound on the feasible region. Using this cut-set bound, we can find the minimum cost network error correction flow in some instances. Moreover, we also consider the relationship between incoming edge-flows and outgoing edge-flows of a vertex. As for the directed acyclic graphs, we propose an algorithm to allocate the network error correction flow. This algorithm is with polynomial time complexity, and proves to be optimal when recoding at intermediate nodes is forbidden. Additionally, in order to justify the necessity of recoding at intermediate nodes, we analyze the benefit of intermediate recoding. On the one hand, we construct a series of instances to prove that intermediate recoding can bring enormous benefits in some networks. On the other hand, numerical analysis shows that the benefit is modest in small random graphs. © 1972-2012 IEEE.",Adversarial errors; Byzantine adversary; cut-set bound; minimum cost; network error correction; resource allocation,Complex networks; Costs; Directed graphs; Error correction; Errors; Graph theory; Optimization; Polynomial approximation; Resource allocation; Allocation problems; Byzantine adversary; Cut-set bound; Directed acyclic graph (DAG); Minimum cost; Network error correction; Optimization problems; Polynomial time complexity; Flow graphs,,,,,"Silva, D., Kschischang, F., Adversarial error correction for network coding: Models and metrics (2008) Proc. 46thAnnu.

The propagation of failures in actual power grids following a catastrophic event differs significantly and thus is harder to analyze than on random networks. This paper studies the structural vulnerability of real power grids to natural disasters and presents improved bounds to quantify the size of the expected damage induced. The performance of the derived bounds are demonstrated through simulations on an IEEE test case and a real grid network. Further a framework based on the eigen-decomposition of the power grid network is used to study adversarial attacks aimed to minimize network resilience. The insights gained are used to design reinforcement measures to improve network resilience against such adversaries. © 2015 IEEE.,,Disasters; Reinforcement; Smart power grids; Catastrophic event; Eigen decomposition; Natural disasters; Network resilience; Power grid networks; Random network; Reinforcement measures; Structural vulnerability; Electric power transmission networks,,,,,"Chi-Keung, W., Horowitz, I., Moore, J., Pacheco, A., The impact of wind generation on the electricity spot-market price level and variance: The Texas experience (2011) Energy Policy, 39; Dobson, I., Carreras, B.A., Lynch, V.E., Newman, D.E., An initial model fo complex dynamics in electric power system blackouts (2001) Proc. 34th Hawaii Int.

However, we lack an evidence-based model the likelihood and intensity of attacks and incidents. Purpose: We propose a model of global capability advancement, the adversarial capability chain (ACC), to fit this need. The model enables cyber risk analysis to better understand the costs for an adversary to attack a system, which directly influences the cost to defend it. Method: The model is based on four historical studies of adversarial capabilities: capability to exploit Windows XP, to exploit the Android API, to exploit Apache, and to administer compromised industrial control systems. Result: We propose the ACC with five phases: Discovery, Validation, Escalation, Democratization, and Ubiquity. We use the four case studies as examples as to how the ACC can be applied and used to predict attack likelihood and intensity. © 2015 IEEE.",CND; computer network defense; cybersecurity; incident response; intelligence; intrusion detection; modeling; security,Computer networks; Crime; Intrusion detection; Models; Network security; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; After-the-fact; Capability model; Cyber security; Evidence-based; Incident response; Industrial control systems; intelligence; security; Cost benefit analysis,,,,,"Hutchins, E.M., Cloppert, M.J., Amin, R.M., Intelligence-driven computer network defense informed by analysis of adversary campaigns and intrusion kill chains (2011) Leading Issues in Information Warfare & Security Research, 1, p. 80; Giere, R.N., How models are used to represent reality (2004) Philosophy of Science, 71 (5), pp. 742-752; Hatleback, E., Spring, J.M., Exploring a mechanistic approach to experimentation in computing (2014) Philosophy & Technology, 27 (3), pp. 441-459; Caralli, R.A., Allen, J.H., White, D.W., (2010) CERT Resilience Management Model: A Maturity Model for Managing Operational Resilience, , Addison-Wesley Professional; Morgan, M.G., (2002) Risk Communication: A Mental Models Approach, , Cambridge University Press; Spring, J.M., Modeling malicious domain name takedown dynamics: Why eCrime pays (2013) IEEE ECrime Researchers Summit, , Anti-Phishing Working Group, September 17; Spring, J.M., Toward realistic modeling criteria of games in internet security (2014) Journal of Cyber Security & Information Systems, 2 (2), pp. 2-11; Metcalf, L.B., Spring, J.M., (2014) Blacklist Ecosystem Analysis Update: 2014, , Tech.

In this paper, we present a significantly improved scenario from the adversarial point of view for DFA against the Grain family of stream ciphers. Our model is the most realistic one so far as it considers that the cipher has to be re-keyed only a few times and faults can be injected at any random location and at any random point of time, i.e., no precise control is needed over the location and timing of fault injections. We construct equations based on the algebraic description of the cipher by introducing new variables so that the degrees of the equations do not increase. In line of algebraic cryptanalysis, we accumulate such equations based on the fault-free and faulty key-stream bits and solve them using the SAT Solver Cryptominisat-2.9.5 installed with SAGE 5.7. In a few minutes we can recover the state of Grain v1, Grain-128 and Grain-128a with as little as 10, 4 and 10 faults respectively. © 1968-2012 IEEE.",Differential fault attack; Grain v1; Grain-128; Grain-128a; LFSR; NFSR; SAT solver; stream cipher,Algebra; Cryptography; Formal logic; Model checking; Differential fault attack; LFSR; NFSR; SAT solvers; Stream Ciphers; Side channel attack,,,,,"Ågren, M., Hell, M., Johansson, T., Meier, W., A new version of Grain-128 with authentication The Symmetric Key Encryption Workshop 2011, , presented at, DTU, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark; Ågren, M., Hell, M., Johansson, T., Meier, W., Grain-128a: A new version of Grain-128 with optional authentication (2011) Int.

Many efforts have been provided in the last years to catch properly the requirements that cryptographic primitives and low-level protocols should meet in order to be useful for building privacy-preserving applications. In particular, anonymity is an important property to achieve, and the notion of key privacy in public-key encryption, which guarantees that an adversary is unable to tell with which public key a certain ciphertext has been produced, plays a key-role in the design of anonymous protocols.Secret sets and anonymous broadcast encryption are two examples of useful anonymous protocols. A secret set is a representation of a subset of users of a given universe satisfying some basic membership privacy properties, and anonymous broadcast encryption is a mechanism to encrypt a broadcast message that only authorized users, whose identities are kept secret, can decrypt.In this paper we show that, even if apparently the key privacy property of an encryption scheme seems to be unrelated to the security of the encrypted content, and it looks like just an additional property the encryption scheme can enjoy, for a robust encryption scheme key privacy under chosen ciphertext attack implies non-malleability and, hence, security under chosen ciphertext attacks. This result helps to simplify the set of requirements that public key encryption schemes need to satisfy when stating and proving theorems regarding anonymous protocols in which the encryption schemes are used.Then, we provide a formal model for both secret sets and anonymous broadcast encryption and we prove that they are equivalent with respect to non-adaptive adversaries: the former can be used to design the latter and vice versa.Finally, we revisit some previous constructions for secret sets, and we analyze the security properties they enjoy within our adversarial model. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Anonymous broadcast encryption; Anonymous protocols; Key privacy; Secret sets,Data privacy; Historic preservation; Public key cryptography; Security of data; Anonymous broadcast; Anonymous protocol; Chosen ciphertext attack; Cryptographic primitives; Key privacy; Public-key encryption; Public-key encryption scheme; Secret sets; Cryptography,,,,,"Abdalla, M., Bellare, M., Neven, G., Robust encryption (2010) LNCS, 5978, pp. 480-497. , Proc. of TCC 2010; Bellare, M., Boldyreva, A., Desai, A., Pointcheval, D., Key-privacy in public-key encryption (2001) LNCS, 2248, pp. 566-582. , Proc. of Asiacrypt 2001; Bellare, M., Desai, A., Pointcheval, D., Rogaway, P., Relations among notions of security for public-key encryption schemes (1998) LNCS, 1462, pp. 26-45. , Proc. of Crypto 1998; Barth, A., Boneh, D., Waters, B., Privacy in encrypted content distribution using private broadcast encryption (2006) LNCS, 4107, pp. 52-64. , Proc. of Financial Cryptography; Catalano, D., Dodis, Y., Visconti, I., Mercurial commitments: minimal assumptions and efficient constructions (2006) LNCS, 3876, pp. 120-144. , Proc. of the Third Theory of Cryptography Conference; Catalano, D., Fiore, D., Messina, M., Zero-knowledge sets with short proofs (2008) LNCS, 4965, pp. 433-450. , Proc. of Eurocrypt 2008; Chase, M., Healy, A., Lysyanskaya, A., Malkin, T., Rezin, L., Mercurial commitments with applications to zero-knowledge sets (2005) LNCS, 3494, pp. 422-439. , Proc. of Eurocrypt 2005; Dolev, D., Dwork, C., Naor, M., Non-malleable cryptography (2000) SIAM J.

Some works conducted over the last years have pointed out that such algorithms are generally susceptible to deception, notably in the form of attacks carefully constructed to evade detection. Various learning schemes have been proposed to overcome this weakness. One such system is Keyed IDS (KIDS), introduced at DIMVA '10. KIDS' core idea is akin to the functioning of some cryptographic primitives, namely to introduce a secret element (the key) into the scheme so that some operations are infeasible without knowing it. In KIDS the learned model and the computation of the anomaly score are both key-dependent, a fact which presumably prevents an attacker from creating evasion attacks. In this work we show that recovering the key is extremely simple provided that the attacker can interact with KIDS and get feedback about probing requests. We present realistic attacks for two different adversarial settings and show that recovering the key requires only a small amount of queries, which indicates that KIDS does not meet the claimed security properties. We finally revisit KIDS' central idea and provide heuristic arguments about its suitability and limitations. © 2015 IEEE.",Adversarial classification; anomaly detection; intrusion detection systems; secure machine learning,Distributed computer systems; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Adversarial classifications; Anomaly detection systems; Cryptographic primitives; Intrusion Detection Systems; Key recovery attacks; Learning schemes; On-machines; Security properties; Anomaly detection,,,,,"Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., Can machine learning be secure?

Although the existing spam filters have satisfying performance, they are facing the challenge of an adversary who misleads the spam filters by manipulating samples. Until now, the vulnerability of spam filtering technique for short messages has not been investigated. Different from the other spam applications, a short message only has a few words and its length usually has an upper limit. The current adversarial learning algorithms may not work efficiently in short message spam filtering. In this paper, we investigate the existing good word attack and its counterattack method, i.e. the feature reweighting, in short message spam filtering in an effort to understand whether, and to what extent, they can work efficiently when the length of a message is limited. This paper proposes a good word attack strategy which maximizes the influence to a classifier with the least number of inserted characters based on the weight values and also the length of words. On the other hand, we also proposes the feature reweighting method with a new rescaling function which minimizes the importance of the feature representing a short word in order to require more inserted characters for a successful evasion. The methods are evaluated experimentally by using the SMS and the comment spam dataset. The results confirm that the length of words is a critical factor of the robustness of short message spam filtering to good word attack. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Adversarial learning; Feature reweighting; Good word attack; Short messages; Spam filtering,Computer applications; Neural networks; Adversarial learning; Good word attack; Re-weighting; Short message; Spam filtering; Learning algorithms; algorithm; Article; automation; classifier; data processing; digital filtering; machine learning; mass communication; quality control procedures; short message spam filtering; text messaging,,,,,"Rajadesingan, A., Mahendran, A., Comment spam classification in blogs through comment analysis and comment-blog post relationships (2012), pp. 490-501. , in: Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing, Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg; Mahmoud, T.M., Mahfouz, A.M., Sms spam filtering technique based on artificial immune system (2012) Int.

Specifically, by combining changes to the gains of the associated law with the appropriate vehicle movements, the attacker can cause the platoon to oscillate at a resonant frequency, causing accidents that could result in serious injury or death. We determine the range of gains, and their corresponding frequencies, that allow an attacker to violate the string stability and stability criteria at different positions in the platoon. Furthermore, we prove that the attack can be successful at any position in the platoon and at frequencies that can be realized by the other vehicles in the platoon. Our work implies that neither the string stability nor stability conditions, when used singly, ensure proper platoon operation, and that neither can be used to ensure the other. Finally, we show that an attacker is theoretically capable of gaining control over the individual position and velocity (states) of other vehicles in the platoon; two attacks are demonstrated for this vulnerability.

The security and resilience of such cyberdefense systems are paramount, since an attacker will try to evade them or render them unusable before attacking the end systems. In this paper, we introduce a system model for IDN nodes in terms of their logical components, functions, and communication channels. This allows us to model different IDN node roles (e.g., detectors, filters, aggregators, correlators, etc.) and architectures (e.g., hierarchical, centralized, fully distributed, etc.). We then introduce a threat model that considers adversarial actions executed against particular IDN nodes, and also the propagation of such actions throughout connected nodes. Based on such models, we finally introduce a countermeasure allocation model based on a multi-objective optimization algorithm to obtain optimal allocation strategies that minimize both risk and cost. Our experimental results obtained through simulation with different IDN architectures illustrate the benefit of our framework to design and reconfigure cyberdefense systems optimally. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Nations such as the United States should be employing this unique but sensitive information in the defense of national security, government, critical infrastructure, and other networks, but doing so may expose the sources and methods behind the intelligence. Once exposed, access to that unique information may be lost. This paper describes the dilemma, presents a partial taxonomy of use cases for which solutions are needed, and offers avenues for supplying those solutions. In particular, solutions to the problem of using classified intelligence for defense of unclassified networks fall into three approaches.

Inherent resource constraints also hinder WSNs from deploying conventional encryption schemes and secure routing protocols. In this paper, we investigate a counter selective forwarding attack to efficiently detect the forwarding misbehaviors of malicious nodes and seamlessly deliver sensory data in energy harvesting WSNs. We first analyze a set of adversarial scenarios under an implicit acknowledgment overhearing and identify a vulnerable case. Then we propose a Hop-by-hop Cooperative Detection (HCD) scheme to efficiently detect the forwarding misbehaviors and mitigate the forwarding probabilities of malicious nodes. Extensive simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the number of forwarding misbehaviors by quickly decreasing the dropping probabilities of malicious nodes and achieve more than 95% packet delivery ratio in energy harvesting WSNs. © 2015 IEEE.",Denial-of-service; energy harvesting; hop-by-hop cooperative detection; selective forwarding attack; wireless sensor networks,Cryptography; Denial-of-service attack; Network protocols; Network security; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Cooperative detection; Denial of Service; Extensive simulations; Forwarding probabilities; Secure routing protocols; Security requirements; Selective forwarding attacks; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Energy harvesting,,,,,"Wood, A.D., Stankovic, J.A., Denial of service in sensor networks (2002) IEEE Computer, 35 (10), pp. 54-62; Lim, S., Kimn, J., Kim, H., Analysis of energy harvesting for vibration-motivated wireless sensor networks (2010) Proc.

Adversarial aircraft are assumed to transmit incorrect position and intent information, potentially leading to violations of separation requirements among aircraft. We propose a framework for the identification of adversaries and malicious aircraft, and then for air traffic control in the presence of such deliberately erroneous data. The framework consists of three mechanisms that allow each aircraft to detect attacks and to resolve conflicts: fault detection and defense techniques to improve Global Positioning System (GPS)/inertial navigation, detection and defense techniques using the Doppler/received signal strength, and a fault-tolerant control algorithm. A Kalman filter is used to fuse high frequency inertial sensor information with low frequency GPS data. To verify aircraft position through GPS/inertial navigation, we propose a technique for aircraft localization utilizing the Doppler effect and received signal strength from neighboring aircraft. The control algorithm is designed to minimize flight times while meeting safety constraints. Additional separation is introduced to compensate for the uncertainty of surveillance information in the presence of adversaries. We evaluate the effect of air traffic surveillance attacks on system performance through simulations. The results show that the proposed mechanism robustly detects and corrects faults generated by the injection of malicious data. Moreover, the proposed control algorithm continuously adapts operations in order to mitigate the effects these faults. The ability of the proposed approaches to defend against attacks enables reliable air traffic operations even in highly adversarial surveillance conditions. © 2012 IEEE.",Automatic dependent surveillance-Broadcast; intelligent control; misbehavior detection; next generation air transportation systems,,,,,,"(2011) FAA, , http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/NextGen-Implementation-Plan-2011.pdf, NextGen Implementation Plan.

Reinforcement learning has not been highly utilized as a method for positioning agents to respond to such events. In our earlier work, which was applied to positioning naval vessel agents to respond to Somali maritime piracy attacks, we developed a method to synthetically augment the information in the events’ environment with digital pheromones and other information augmenters, used the resulting augmenter signatures as states that agents could react to, and applied reinforcement learning to exploit regularities in the timing and location of events to position agents in spatio-temporal proximity of anticipated events. This work extends that methodology with a new learning boosting method wherein learning is improved as partial augmenter signatures are reinforced, which is not possible when learning is based only on the aggregated state. The enhanced methodology is applied to positioning police patrols in response to a sequence of business robberies in Denver, Colorado and its effectiveness is analyzed. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Autonomous agents; Digital pheromones; Partial-state learning; Reinforcement learning; Synthetic information augmentation,"Autonomous agents; Crime; Hormones; Learning systems; Naval vessels; Augmented environments; Denver , Colorado; Digital pheromones; Partial state; Sequence of events; Spatio temporal; Spatiotemporal patterns; Synthetic information augmentation; Reinforcement learning",,,,,"Barbosa, S.E., Petty, M.D., Reinforcement learning in an environment synthetically augmented with digital pheromones (2014) Adv.

The supply-side strategy has not halted executions, however. Rather, the unintended consequences of shrinking the execution drug supply are heightened risks of harm as states resort to alternative drugs and a surge of new state secrecy laws to protect remaining supply sources. The new secrecy laws are facing a barrage of legal challenges and a circuit split on how to resolve them. This Article is about the unintended consequences of the supply-side attack strategy and how harm reduction is better served by challenging the lack of notice and adversarial testing regarding new drug protocols rather than outing and attacking the last remaining licensed suppliers. While execution drug supplier confidentiality laws are often conflated with concealment of the method of execution, the Article argues it is important to distinguish the two. The success-and downsides-of the drug supplier outing strategy illustrates the legitimate harm prevention rationale behind execution drug supplier confidentiality laws. Confidentiality serves the important interest of safeguarding remaining licensed drug sources and reducing the need to resort to questionable backroom sources abroad or old methods of execution such as firing squads. In contrast, eleventh-hour drug substitutions heighten the risk of unintended suffering because the death cocktail protocol has not been subject to sufficient adversarial testing, much less scientific evaluation. For those concerned about reducing harm, it is counterproductive to attack compounding pharmacies licensed as competent to produce drugs for the public. Rather the focus should be on sufficient notice regarding the lethal injection protocol to evaluate and challenge changes in cocktail combinations, which pose a far greater risk of harm.",,,,,,,"Abbott, G., (1991) Lords of the Scaffold: A History of the Execution, 26; Banner, S., (2002) The Death Penalty: An American History, pp. 38-39; Bessler, J.D., (1997) Death in the Dark: Midnight Executions in America, pp. 23-28; Laurence, J., (1960) A History of Capital Punishment, 25; Sarat, A., The cultural life of capital punishment: Responsibility and representation in dead man walking and last dance (1999) The Killing State: Capital Punishment in Law, Politics, and Culture, 226, p. 250. , (Austin Sarat ed); Bever, L., (2014) States Work to Keep Execution Secrets amid Death Row's Desire to Know, , http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/03/26/states-work-to-keep-execution-secrets-amid-death-rows-desire-to-know, Mar. 26; http://perma.cc/P9YS-HE9W; McCracken, M., Moreno, J., Secret drugs, agonizing deaths (2014) N.Y.

Most enterprise security managers today simply patch the most dangerous vulnerabilities-an adversary can thus easily compromise an enterprise by using less important vulnerabilities to penetrate an enterprise. In this article, we capture the vulnerabilities in an enterprise as a Vulnerability Dependency Graph (VDG) and show that attacks graphs can be expressed in them. We first ask the question: What set of vulnerabilities should an attacker exploit in order to maximize his expected impact? We show that this problem can be solved as an integer linear program. The defender would obviously like to minimize the impact of the worst-case attack mounted by the attacker-but the defender also has an obligation to ensure a high productivity within his enterprise. We propose an algorithm that finds a Pareto-optimal solution for the defender that allows him to simultaneously maximize productivity and minimize the cost of patching products on the enterprise network. We have implemented this framework and show that runtimes of our computations are all within acceptable time bounds even for large VDGs containing 30K edges and that the balance between productivity and impact of attacks is also acceptable. © 2015 ACM 1094-9224/2015/03-ART11 $15.00.",Adversarial models; Computer security; Enterprise systems,Integer programming; Productivity; Security of data; Security systems; Enterprise networks; Enterprise security; Enterprise system; High productivity; Integer linear programs; National Institute of Standards and Technology; National vulnerability database; Pareto optimal solutions; Pareto principle,,,,,"Albanese, M., Jajodia, S., Singhal, A., Wang, L., An efficient approach to assessing the risk of zero-day vulnerabilities (2013) Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Security and Cryptpgraphy (SECRYPT), , Reykjavik, Iceland; Alpcan, T., Buchegger, S., Security games for vehicular networks (2011) IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, 10 (2), pp. 280-290. , 2011; Altman, E., Avrachenkov, K., Gamaev, A., Jamming in wireless networks: The case of several jammers (2009) Proceedings of the First ICST International Conference on Game Theory for Networks (GameNets'09), pp. 585-592. , IEEE Press; Ammann, P., Wijesekera, D., Kaushik, S., Scalable, graph-based network vulnerability analysis (2002) Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS 2002), pp. 217-224. , Washington, DC, USA; Barnhart, C., Johnson, E.L., Nemhauser, G.L., Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Vance, P.H., Branch-and-price: Column generation for solving huge integer programs (1998) Operations Research, 46 (3), pp. 316-329. , 1998; Basar, T., The Gaussian test channel with an intelligent jammer (2006) IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 29 (1), pp. 152-157. , 2006; Dacier, M., (1994) Towards Quantitative Evaluation of Computer Security, , Ph.

Los Angeles, United States","We address the problem of reconstructing the state of a differentially flat system from measurements that may be corrupted by an adversarial attack. In cyber-physical systems, malicious attacks can directly compromise the system's sensors or manipulate the communication between sensors and controllers. We consider attacks that only corrupt a subset of sensor measurements. We show that the possibility of reconstructing the state under such attacks is characterized by a suitable generalization of the notion of s-sparse observability, previously introduced by some of the authors in the linear case. We also extend our previous work on the use of Satisfiability Modulo Theory solvers to reconstruct the state under sensor attacks to the context of differentially flat systems. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated on the problem of controlling a quadrotor under sensor attacks. © 2015 IEEE.",,Embedded systems; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Differentially flat system; Malicious attack; Quad rotors; Satisfiability modulo Theories; Sensor measurements; State reconstruction; Formal logic,,,,,"Langner, R., Stuxnet: Dissecting a cyberwarfare weapon (2011) IEEE Security and Privacy Magazine, 9 (3), pp. 49-51; Liu, Y., Ning, P., Reiter, M.K., False data injection attacks against state estimation in electric power grids (2009) Proc.

However, the number of sensors that can be deployed is often limited by financial or technological constraints. This problem is further complicated by the presence of strategic adversaries, who may disable some of the deployed sensors in order to impair the operator's ability to make predictions. Assuming that the operator employs a Gaussian-process-based regression model, we formulate the problem of attack-resilient sensor placement as the problem of selecting a subset from a set of possible observations, with the goal of minimizing the uncertainty of predictions. We show that both finding an optimal resilient subset and finding an optimal attack against a given subset are NP-hard problems. Since both the design and the attack problems are computationally complex, we propose efficient heuristic algorithms for solving them and present theoretical approximability results.

Traditional descriptive threat models are often considered insufficient for accurate and mathematical numerical risk analyses of such critical infrastructures. In this paper, we propose TMQ, a novel and scalable threat model quantification method to create numerical models of various threat categories automatically. In particular, TMQ makes use of several sources of information to quantify the individual threat vectors. First, TMQ utilizes the smart grid network topology and global security access control policies to create a state-based security model for the smart grid using the Markov decision processes formalism. Then, TMQ utilizes traditional descriptive threat models, historical attack reports, intrusion detection logs as well as reports/interviews by/with hackers to quantify adversarial viewpoints of attackers from various threat categories against the smart grid. The result is an automatically generated model with specialized reward functions for each category of attackers. Our experimental results on a smart grid testbed network with several vulnerabilities show that TMQ can accurately quantify traditional descriptive threat models efficiently. © 2014 IEEE.",,Access control; Critical infrastructures; Electric power transmission networks; Intrusion detection; Markov processes; Mobile telecommunication systems; Numerical methods; Personal computing; Public works; Risk analysis; Risk management; Smart power grids; Topology; Automatically generated; In-depth understanding; Markov Decision Processes; Quantification methods; Security risk managements; Security solutions; Smart grid networks; Sources of informations; Network security,,,,,"(2012) Open Web Application Security Project, , https://www.owasp.org/index.php/ThreatRiskModeling; Ammann, P., Wijesekera, D., Kaushik, S., Scalable, graph-based network vulnerability analysis (2002) Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS), pp. 217-224; Bellman, R., (2003) Dynamic Programming, , Princeton University Press, 1957; republished; Berger, J.O., (1993) Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis, , Springer, New York; Berthier, R., Sanders, W.H., Khurana, H., Intrusion detection for advanced metering infrastructures: Requirements and architectural directions (2010) Proceedings of the 1st IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications, pp. 350-355; Chib, S., Greenberg, E., Understanding the metropolis-hastings algorithm (1995) The American Statistician, 49 (4), pp. 327-335; Datta Ray, P., Harnoor, R., Hentea, M., (2010) Smart Power Grid Security: A Unified Risk Management Approach, pp. 276-285; Filar, J., Vrieze, K., (1997) Competitive Markov Decision Processes, , Springer-Verlag; James, C., Foster, (2007) Metasploit Toolkit for Penetration Testing, Exploit Development, and Vulnerability Research; Kaelbling, L., Littman, M., Cassandra, A., Partially observable Markov decision processes for artificial intelligence (1995) Proceedings of the German Conference on Artificial Intelligence: Advances in Artificial Intelligence, 981, pp. 1-17; Lemay, E., Unkenholz, W., Parks, D., Muehrcke, C., Keefe, K., Sanders, W.H., Adversary-driven state-based system security evaluation (2010) Proceedings of the 6th International Workshop on Security Measurements and Metrics, pp. 51-59; McIntyre, A., Becker, B., Halbgewachs, R., Security metrics for process control systems (2007) Sandia Report; Muehrcke, C., Ruitenbeek, E.V., Keefe, K., Sanders, W.H., Characterizing the behavior of cyber adversaries: The means, motive, and opportunity of cyberattacks (2010) IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks; Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning Proceedings of the 20th International Joint Conference on Artifical Intelligence, IJCAI'07, pp. 2586-2591. , Deepak Ramachandran and Eyal Amir, San Francisco, CA, USA, 2007.

The suggested SHIELD is expected to be a ultra-lower power, minuscule electronic component that is physically attached to the host IC. This paper focuses on two important adversarial acts on SHIELD: physical reverse engineering and physical side-channel analysis. These attacks can be launched through mechanical or optical means and they can reveal and/or modify the confidential on-chip data or enable reverse-engineering of the design. For detection of these attacks and subsequent erasing of the sensitive data, sensors, erasure devices, and the relevant control circuitry need to be added to the SHIELD. We describe the device-level operation of the optical (photodetectors) and mechanical (nano-or micro-electromechanical switches) sensors and how they can be integrated within an IC to detect physical attacks. The operation of these micro/nano-scale sensors is unreliable due to environmental, operational, and structural fluctuations and noise. We outline system-level approaches to design a reliable countermeasure against physical attacks using unreliable sensors. © 2014 IEEE.",,Computer aided design; Computer hardware; Electromechanical devices; Hardware security; Integrated circuits; Optical switches; Reverse engineering; Side channel attack; Supply chains; Timing circuits; Control circuitry; Electromechanical switches; Electronic component; Physical attacks; Sensitive datas; Side-channel analysis; Structural fluctuations; System-level approach; Integrated circuit design,,,,,"(2014) Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Microsystems Technology Office/MTO Broad Agency Announcement, , Supply chain hardware integrity for electronics defense (SHIELD); Rostami, M., Koushanfar, F., Karri, R., A primer on hardware security: Threat models, metrics, and remedies (2014) Proceedings of the IEEE, 102 (8), pp. 1283-1295. , Aug; Gassend, B., Clarke, D., Van Dijk, M., Devadas, S., Silicon physical random functions (2002) ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 148-160; Chu, J., Fritz, G., Hovel, H., Kim, Y., Pfeiffer, D., Rodbell, K., (2014) Integrated Circuit Tamper Detection and Response, p. 078. , http://www.google.com/patents/US20140103286, US, Patent App 13/654; Hsu, L., Kruger, D., Mason, J., Oldrey, R., (2012) Implementing Tamper Resistant Integrated Circuit Chips, p. 285. , https://www.google.com/patents/US8089285, US, Patent 8 089; Abadeer, W., (2010) CMOS Imaging Sensor Having A Third FET Device with A Gate Terminal Coupled to A Second Diffusion Region of A First FET Device and A First Terminal Coupled to A Row Select Signal, , https://www.google.com/patents/US7692130, US Patent 7, 692, 130; Fuentes-Fernandez, E., Shah, P., Mechtaly-Debray, W., Gnade, B., (2014) Mems-based Cantilever Energy Harvester, p. 590. , https://www.google.com/patents/US20140087509, US Patent App, 14/094; Choi, W., Jeon, Y., Jeong, J.-H., Sood, R., Kim, S., Energy harvesting MEMS device based on thin film piezoelectric cantilevers (2006) Journal of Electroceramics, 17 (2-4); Das, R., Markovich, V., McNamara, J., Poliks, M., (2012) Antitamper Microchip Package Based on Thermal Nanofluids or Fluids, p. 857. , http://www.google.com.ar/patents/US8288857, US, Patent 8, 288; (2002) Federal Information Processing Standard Publication (FIPS PUB 140-2, , http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips140-2/fips1402.pdf, Security requirements for cryptographic modules; Lemke, K., (2006) Embedded Security: Physical Protection Against Tampering Attacks, 12, pp. 207-217. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-28428-1; Dyer, J.G., Lindemann, M., Perez, R., Sailer, R., Van Doorn, L., Smith, S.W., Weingart, S., Building the IBM 4758 secure coprocessor (2001) Computer, 34 (10), pp. 57-66; English, J., Coe, D., Gaede, R., Hyde, D., Kulick, J., Mems-Assisted cryptography for cpi protection (2007) Security and Privacy, 5 (4), pp. 14-21; Koushanfar, F., Karri, R., Can the shield protect our integrated circuits?

In these graphs, the degree distribution of the nodes obeys the power-law property: the fraction of nodes P (k) having a degree k closely follows the rule P (k) ∝ k-γ. In the domain of man-made systems, if the topology of a power-law network gets altered due to failures or adversarial attacks, then remedial actions to restore the power-law property are very important. This paper presents self-stabilizing algorithms for maintaining the power-law property in a network of processes. These algorithms allow spontaneous restoration of the power-law property from any initial connected configuration. The algorithms consist of three modular components: a detection component to detect the violation of the power-law property, an interim topology creation component, and a repair component to build the final graph. We propose two different interim topologies, a clique and a linear graph. We then present two different techniques for rebuilding the power-law topology - a probabilistic approach based on the preferential attachment model, which stabilizes in O(log n) communication rounds with a link complexity of O(n) per process, and a deterministic approach that introduces the novel data structure BRIDGE TREE and stabilizes in O(n) communication rounds with a much lower link complexity.

Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, United States; Insua, D.R., Institute of Mathematical Sciences, ICMAT-CSIC, Madrid, Spain","Winner of the 2017 De Groot Prize awarded by the International Society for Bayesian Analysis (ISBA) A relatively new area of research, adversarial risk analysis (ARA) informs decision making when there are intelligent opponents and uncertain outcomes. Adversarial Risk Analysis develops methods for allocating defensive or offensive resources against intelligent adversaries. Many examples throughout illustrate the application of the ARA approach to a variety of games and strategic situations. • Focuses on the recent subfield of decision analysis, ARA • Compares ideas from decision theory and game theory • Uses multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) throughout to help readers visualize complex information structures • Applies the ARA approach to simultaneous games, auctions, sequential games, and defend-attack games Ȃ; Contains an extended case study based on a real application in railway security, which provides a blueprint for how to perform ARA in similar security situations • Includes exercises at the end of most chapters, with selected solutions at the back of the book The book shows decision makers how to build Bayesian models for the strategic calculation of their opponents, enabling decision makers to maximize their expected utility or minimize their expected loss. This new approach to risk analysis asserts that analysts should use Bayesian thinking to describe their beliefs about an opponent's goals, resources, optimism, and type of strategic calculation, such as minimax and level-k thinking. Within that framework, analysts then solve the problem from the perspective of the opponent while placing subjective probability distributions on all unknown quantities. This produces a distribution over the actions of the opponent and enables analysts to maximize their expected utilities. © 2016 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Alderson, D.L., Brown, G.G., Carlyle, W.M., Wood, R.K., Solving Defender-Attacker-DefenderModels for Infrastructure Defense (2011) Operations Research, Computing, and Homeland Defense, pp. 28-49. , R.

Detecting adversarial activities, prevention of theft of intellectual properties and customer data is a high priority for corporations and government agencies around the world. Cyber defenders need to analyze massive-scale, high-resolution network flows to identify, categorize, and mitigate attacks involving networks spanning institutional and national boundaries. Many of the cyber attacks can be described as subgraph patterns, with prominent examples being insider infiltrations (path queries), denial of service (parallel paths) and malicious spreads (tree queries). This motivates us to explore subgraph matching on streaming graphs in a continuous setting. The novelty of our work lies in using the subgraph distributional statistics collected from the streaming graph to determine the query processing strategy. We introduce a ""Lazy Search"" algorithm where the search strategy is decided on a vertex-to-vertex basis depending on the likelihood of a match in the vertex neighborhood. We also propose a metric named ""Relative Selectivity"" that is used to select between different query processing strategies. Our experiments performed on real online news, network traffic stream and a synthetic social network benchmark demonstrate 10-100x speedups over selectivity agnostic approaches. © 2015, Copyright is with the authors.",,Crime; Denial-of-service attack; Pattern recognition; Denial of Service; Government agencies; Networks spanning; Pattern detection; Processing strategies; Search strategies; Subgraph matching; Technical challenges; Query processing,,,,,"Barbieri, D.F., Braga, D., Ceri, S., Valle, E.D., Grossniklaus, M., C-sparql: A continuous query language for rdf data streams (2010) Int.

By utilizing the properties of transmission medium in physical layer, our scheme can achieve high transmission efficiency as well as information theoretic security. With the secrecy capacity analysis, we show that our scheme is a secure approach under two different adversarial models: 1) untrusted relay attack model; 2) trusted relay with eavesdropper attack model. Finally, we conduct three simulations of our proposed scheme. The simulation results agree with the theoretical analysis illustrating that our proposed scheme can achieve a better performance than the existing schemes. © 2015 IEEE.",,Electric relays; Information theory; Local area networks; MIMO systems; Network layers; Transmissions; Capacity analysis; Communication partners; Information- theoretic securities; MIMO two-way relay channels; Physical layer security; Secure transmission; Transmission medium; Two-way relay channels; Communication channels (information theory),,,,,"Wyner, A., The wire-tap channel (1975) Bell System Technical Journal, the, 54, pp. 1355-1387. , Oct; Oohama, Y., Capacity theorems for relay channels with confidential messages (2007) Information Theory, 2007.ISIT 2007.IEEE International Symposium on, pp. 926-930. , June; Mukherjee, A., Fakoorian, S.A.A., Huang, J., Swindlehurst, A.L., Principles of physical layer security in multiuser wireless networks: A survey (2014) IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 16 (3), pp. 1550-1573; Jeong, C., Kim, I., Kim, D.I., Joint secure beamforming design at the source and the relay for an amplify-and-forward MIMO untrusted relay system (2012) IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 60 (1), pp. 310-325; Zhang, R., Song, L., Han, Z., Jiao, B., Physical layer security for two-way untrusted relaying with friendly jammers (2012) IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 61 (8), pp. 3693-3704; Mo, J., Tao, M., Liu, Y., Wang, R., Secure beamforming for MIMO two-way communications with an untrusted relay (2014) IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 62 (9), pp. 2185-2199; Ding, Z., Peng, M., Chen, H., A general relaying transmission protocol for MIMO secrecy communications (2012) IEEE Transactions on Communications, 60 (11), pp. 3461-3471; Jayasinghe, K., Jayasinghe, P., Rajatheva, N., Latva-Aho, M., Secure beamforming design for physical layer network coding based MIMO two-way relaying (2014) IEEE Communications Letters, 18 (7), pp. 1270-1273; Yang, T., Yuan, X., Ping, L., Collings, I.B., Yuan, J., A new physicallayer network coding scheme with eigen-direction alignment precoding for MIMO two-way relaying (2013) IEEE Transactions on Communications, 61 (3), pp. 973-986; Khisti, A., Wornell, G., Wiesel, A., Eldar, Y., On the Gaussian MIMO wiretap channel (2007) Information Theory, 2007.ISIT 2007.IEEE International Symposium on, pp. 2471-2475. , IEEE; Liu, Q., Gong, G., Wang, Y., Li, H., (2015) A Novel Physical Layer Security Scheme for MIMO Two-Way Relay Channels, , CACR 2015-05 Technical Report, University of Waterloo",,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"IEEE Globecom Workshops, GC Wkshps 2015",6 December 2015 through 10 December 2015,,119593,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"IEEE Globecom Workshops, GC Wkshps",Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84971275487

In a radio jamming, an attacker can jam a channel by emitting a radio signal in certain strength without understanding the protocol. It may also try to disrupt the RF operations of a communication protocol if it understands the protocol. Detection of the jamming has been very challenging, particularly in adversarial environment. Current detection mechanisms using signal strength related metrics rely on extensive measurements that require hardware implementation due to lack of appropriate analytical models. In this work, we propose a novel detection method based on the decomposition relationship between effective channel utilization (ECU) and the interference power from undesirable nodes. This method detects power-based jamming attacks against wireless networks. A new metric using ECU is integrated into the algorithm of the detection of radio jamming. In addition, the method is implemented in OPNET with a dynamic radio channel allocation (RCA) module that monitors and reallocates the channel if being detected as jammed.

Feature selection has been widely used in machine learning for security applications to improve generalization and computational efficiency, although it is not clear whether its use may be beneficial or even counterproductive when training data are poisoned by intelligent attackers. In this work, we shed light on this issue by providing a framework to investigate the robustness of popular feature selection methods, including LASSO, ridge regression and the elastic net. Our results on malware detection show that feature selection methods can be significantly compromised under attack (we can reduce LASSO to almost random choices of feature sets by careful insertion of less than 5% poisoned training samples), highlighting the need for specific countermeasures.

What makes this estimation problem particularly challenging is its sequential and adaptive nature. As participants are allowed to repeatedly evaluate their submissions on the leaderboard, they may begin to overfit to the holdout data that supports the leaderboard. Few theoretical results give actionable advice on how to design a reliable leader-board. Existing approaches therefore often resort to poorly understood heuristics such as limiting the bit precision of answers and the rate of re-submission. In this work, we introduce a notion of leader-board accuracy tailored to the format of a competition. We introduce a natural algorithm called the Ladder and demonstrate that it simultaneously supports strong theoretical guarantees in a fully adaptive model of estimation, withstands practical adversarial attacks, and achieves high utility on real submission files from an actual competition hosted by Kaggle. Notably, we are able to sidestep a powerful recent hardness result for adaptive risk estimation that rules out algorithms such as ours under a seemingly very similar notion of accuracy. On a practical note, we provide a completely parameter-free variant of our algorithm that can be deployed in a real competition with no tuning required whatsoever.

An operational resiliency model describes a measurement process while demonstrating the scope of achieving resiliency through a dynamic process that includes anticipation of negative effects, withstanding the affects, recovery, and network evolution. In order to maintain the command and control (C2) advantage during military operations and throughout cyberspace, the measure of functional resiliency must be quantified for integrated and operational systems to provide network defenders and military decision makers the level of capability (to recover) following a significant cyber incident or a catastrophic natural event. To achieve functional resonance, and vet potential and future threats, technologies competing for network resources must be identified and stressed to determine their role in resiliency and the potential affect they will have on operational systems during an aggressive cyber attack. Through network analysis, based on actual adversarial research and case studies, adaptive analysis teams collect the necessary data to determine a systems' resonance characteristics, specifically, interdependent technologies and processes that can negatively affect a single system or an enterprise network. The traditional role of a vulnerability analysis team is to identify and exploit every vulnerable system or process in order to expose and mitigate weaknesses for the purpose of creating a more viable network. This scope is narrow and confined to a limited range of requirements or technologies based on a similarly narrow set of objectives and goals. To compound the problems associated with obtaining an acceptable resilient posture for a specific system or an enterprise network is the IT industry's misconception that resiliency is tantamount to bandwidth and not a measurement of capability. Network managers attempt to solve poor resiliency by installing more network appliances (redundancy) and adding additional bandwidth; both costly and often ineffective. It is paramount that network managers first identify their current resiliency and associated functional resonance issues prior to initiating corrective actions. The intent of this research is to identify current methods of measuring or achieving acceptable resilience for an enterprise network, identify shortfalls in acquiring accurate and actionable data, and the incorrect application of mitigations that result in no or little resiliency enhancement. The author outlines a process to accurately measure a networks resiliency posture, which will lead to effective mitigations and enhancements allowing for a rapid and cost-effective recovery of functionality.",Cyber warfare; Functional resiliency; Functional resonance,Bandwidth; Command and control systems; Computer system recovery; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Managers; Military applications; Military operations; Network security; Recovery; Resonance; Command and control (C2); Cyber warfare; Functional resiliency; Functional resonance; Measurement process; Operational systems; Resonance characteristic; Vulnerability analysis; Computer crime,,,,,"Becker, S., Leung, S., Bocher, R., (2012) Benchmark 9: How Much Bandwidth?, , Libraryedge.org; Bodeau, D.J., Gaubart, R., (2011) Cyber Engineering Framework: MITRE Technical Report MTR 110237; (2014) IT Uses its Own IT Technologies to Achieve Business Resilience, , http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ciscoitatwork/downloads/ciscoitatwork/pdf/Cisco_IT_Case_Study_Business__Resilience.pdf, May Cisco IT Case Study Business Resilience; Hollnagel, E., (2012) Fram: The Functional Resonance Analysis Method: Modeling Complex Socio-technical Systems, , Ashgate Publishing, Ltd; (2013), http://www.incose.org/practice/techactivities/wg/rswg/; Kimmance, J., (2012) Infrastructure Risk and Resilience, , Dr. BCI Workshop, Bristol; Liu, G., Ji, C., (2008) Scalability of Network-Failure Resilience.

For the capability to be effective, they need to know how the attack process works, what resources are required, what doctrine should be followed, and how to command, control, and govern such integrated operations. Simulation is a powerful technology for gaining understanding about these issues. While the general principles and techniques for developing and employing simulations are well known, their application to professional offensive cyber operations is new. The purpose of this paper is to present a preliminary requirements specification for a new, agent-based simulator capable of modelling professional offensive cyber operations in a networked environment. Because attack may be the best means for defence, simulation encompasses the adversarial interaction between attacker(s) and defender(s). The requirements cover the applications-independent simulation infrastructure, touching on time handling, stochastic behaviour, the modelling representation, interfacing, and simulation control, and the cyber operations application.

Most efforts have been devoted on hiding the watermark and increasing the robustness of the embedded watermark under common signal processing operations and geometric transformations. In this paper, we build our scheme based on these previous well developed signal processing techniques but focus on how to employ unpredictable signature-seeded pseudo random bit sequence to make the false negative watermark detection rate computationally negligible. The ultimate goal is to resolve the ownership dispute of an exhibited digital media under adversarial watermark removal attacks. © 2015 IEEE.",Copyright protection; Digital signature; Pseudo random bit sequence; Watermark,Digital storage; Electronic document identification systems; Mathematical transformations; Security of data; Signal processing; Watermarking; Common signal processing; Copyright protections; Digital Rights Management; Embedded watermarks; Geometric transformations; Pseudo random bit sequences; Signal processing technique; Watermark detection; Copyrights,,,,,"Blum, L., Blum, M., Shub, M., A simple unpredictable PseudoRandom number generator (1986) SIAM Journal on Computing, 15 (2), pp. 364-383; Blum, M., Micali, S., How to generate cryptographically strong sequences of pseudo-random bits (1982) SIAM Journal on Computing, 13 (4), pp. 850-864. , extended abstract in FOCS; Boneh, D., Shaw, J., Collusion-secure fingerprinting for digital data (1995) Advances in Cryptology - Crypto'95, 963, pp. 452-465. , LNCS Springer-Verlag; Cox, I.J., Kilian, J., Leighton, T., Shamoon, T., Secure spread spectrum watermarking for multimedia (1997) IEEE Trans.

These attacks have capabilities to degrade the performance of the managed network or bring it down in the worst case For this reason, a large-scale deployment of SDN needs evaluation of the impact of adversarial attacks on network services. In thi work, we implement various attacks in SDN and analyze their impact on the performance of web-based services running over it Prior to that, we briefly discuss different kinds of vulnerabilities and threats in SDN. We consider the connection set-up latency and loss, for web-client requests, as metrics for the evaluation. We observe a significant degradation in the performances of web services, in terms of response time and availability, in the presence of implemented attacks. © 2015 The Authors.

An important consideration with respect to the mission/safety critical infrastructure supporting space operations is that an appropriate defensive response to an attackhas the goal to preserve critical mission objectives in the presence of adversarial activity. Which invariably involves the need for high precision and accuracy, because an incorrect response can trigger unacceptable losses involving lives and/or significant financial damage. A highly precise defensive response, considering the typical complexity of aerospace environments, requires a detailed and well-founded understanding of the underlying system. To capture this detailed and rigorous understanding, a structured approach for modeling aerospace systems has been developed. The approach includes physical elements, network topology, software applications, system functions, and usage scenarios. We leverage Model-Based Systems Engineering methodology by utilizing the Object Management Group’s Systems Modeling Language to represent the system being analyzed and also utilize model transformations to provide relevant aspects of the model to specialized analyses. A novel visualization approach is utilized to visualize the entire model as a three-dimensional graph, allowing easier interaction with subject matter experts. The model provides a unifying structure for analyzing the impact of a particular attack or a particular type of attack. A graph-based propagation analysis based on edge and node labels is used to analyze the model. © 2015, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

However, most current approaches use honey-nets relying on the assumption that simply attracting intruders into honeypots would thwart the attack. In this chapter, we propose a different and more realistic approach, which aims at delaying intrusions, so as to control the probability that an intruder will reach a certain goal within a specified amount of time. Our method relies on analyzing a graphical representation of the computer network’s logical layout and an associated probabilistic model of the adversary’s behavior. We then artificially modify this representation by adding ""distraction clusters""-collections of interconnected virtual machines-at key points of the network in order to increase complexity for the intruders and delay the intrusion. We study this problem formally, showing it to be NP-hard and then provide an approximation algorithm that exhibits several useful properties. Finally, we compare recent approach for selecting a subset of distraction clusters with our prototypal implementation of the proposed framework and then unveil experimental results. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",Adversarial modeling; Graph theory; Moving target defense,Approximation algorithms; Complex networks; Electronic commerce; Graph theoretic approach; Graphical representations; Honey net; Moving target defense; Network intrusions; Probabilistic modeling; Useful properties; Virtual machines; Graph theory,,,,,"Abbasi, F., Harris, R., Moretti, G., Haider, A., Anwar, N., Classification of malicious network streams using honeynets (2012) Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), pp. 891-897; Alpcan, T., Baar, T., (2010) Network Security: A Decision and Game-Theoretic Approach, 1St Edn, , Cambridge University Press, New York; Chen, C.M., Cheng, S.T., Zeng, R.Y., A proactive approach to intrusion detectionandmalwarecollection.Secur (2013) Commun.Netw, 6 (7), pp. 844-853. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sec.619; Chen, W., Wang, C., Wang, Y., Scalable influence maximization for prevalent viral marketing in large-scale social networks (2010) Proceedings of the 16Th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 1029-1038; Evans, D., Nguyen-Tuong, A., Knight, J.C., Moving Target Defense: Creating Asymmetric Uncertainty for Cyber Threats, Chap (2011) Effectiveness of Moving Target Defenses, p. 29. , Springer, New York; Feige, U., A threshold of ln n for approximating set cover (1998) J.

Mitigating these risks involves designing robust network topologies in situations where resources are economically constrained. In this study, we consider the vulnerability of network topologies from an economic viewpoint and propose security metrics, which are necessary for assessing the efficiency of our solutions. We define the vulnerability of a network as the potential loss in connectivity due to the actions of a strategic adversary. To derive vulnerability metrics, we revisit our recently introduced network blocking game models, which provide a framework for quantifying network topology vulnerability in adversarial environments. We assume that the network operator takes both security and economic goals into consideration. To model these goals, we generalize previous models by introducing usage costs and budget constraints for the operator. We study two natural constraint formulations, the maximum and the expected cost constraints, and derive the feasible vulnerability/cost region. Because the proposed metrics are based on game-theoretic models, computing them can be challenging. To elucidate these challenges, we provide a thorough complexity analysis for solving the proposed games. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Albert, R., Jeong, H., Barabási, A., Error and Attack Tolerance of Complex Networks.

Also, real networks are dynamic in their nature due to intentional or unintentional changes on network link service rates or tra nsient link failures. Our interest is focused on FIFO compositions with other contention-resolution protocols due to the FIFO popularity for offering best-effort services in packet-switched networks. A packet-switched network is stable, if the number of packets in the network remains bounded at all times against any adversary. We use an enhanced adversarial framework that is based on an adversary that controls packet injection rates, along with packet paths, and manipulates link slowdowns or capacities. Within this framework, we study the impact of specific compositions of FIFO with other protocols on the network stability using as a test-bed specific network topologies which have been proved forbidden for stability for a single protocol, fixed link slowdowns/ capacities and packet paths without repeated links/edges. Our results suggest that the instability behavior of a network using FIFO compositions under adversarial attacks, that dynamically change link slowdowns/ capacities, is not only maintained, but, also, may become worse than in the case of attacks that do not change slowdowns/capacities or when a single protocol, like FIFO, is employed on all network queues for contention-resolution. We believe that this study can advance the research for the provision of trustworthy heterogeneous networks. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,Heterogeneous networks; Internet protocols; Packet networks; Stability; Switching circuits; Best effort services; Contention resolution; Contention resolution protocols; Heterogeneous dynamics; Multimedia networks; Multimedia packets; Network stability; Packet injection; Telecommunication links,,,,,"Alvarez, C., Blesa, M., Serna, M., A characterization of universal stability in the adversarial queuing model (2004) SIAM J.

Unfortunately, this technique is designed for non-adversarial settings. Dishonest peers may cheat in their distance measurements. Outside attackers may interfere with the acoustic ranging by continually broadcasting interference signals. In this paper, we propose countermeasures against each of these attacks. We first present an algorithm that can identify peers that are not cheating in the current localization, by searching for devices that can be embedded into the same plane according to their pairwise distances. We also design a robust acoustic ranging method exploiting signal modulation, which can defend effectively against intentional interference of outside attackers.

Designing a functionally correct system, or a performance constrained system is fundamentally different in the sense that such design requires us to build models and to systematically refine models towards implementation such that correctness is preserved between refinements, and performance optimizations are introduced during refinements. Designing systems with cyber-security properties requires us to not only build models from theoretical principles, but also require modeling possible behaviors of an adversary. Modeling adversarial behavior is akin to test-driven model refinement, and hence not so different from certain approaches used when our goal is functionally correct design. However, for cyber-physical systems, we often need to detect an ongoing cyber attack since safe guards for cyber security often depend on assumptions which can be invalidated (e. g., insider attacks may invalidate perimeter security assumptions). Detecting ongoing attacks requires detecting behavioral anomalies in the physical system under cyber control – thus requiring us to build models from data. Machine learning approaches could be used to build such models. This we view as a schizoid approach – since the designer has to not only model the system from physical principles, he/she also has to build nominal behavioral models from data. While arguing this point of view, we introduce a virtual SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) laboratory we have built to help design cyber security of critical systems. The majority of this talk focuses on describing this software based virtual laboratory called VSCADA. Most of this research is published in [8, 11] and summarized here for the sake of exposition to the present audience. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,Artificial intelligence; Constrained optimization; Cryptography; Data acquisition; Design; Embedded systems; Learning systems; Public works; SCADA systems; Constrained systems; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Machine learning approaches; Performance optimizations; Perimeter security; Physical principles; Supervisory control and data acquisition; Virtual laboratories; Critical infrastructures,,,,,"Krutz, R.L., (2005) Securing SCADA Systems, , Wiley Publishing, Inc; Craig, P.A., Mortensen, J., Dagle, J.E., (2008) Metrics for the National SCADA Test Bed Program, , Report, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Reaves, B., Morris, T., An open virtual test bed for industrial control system security research (2012) International Journal of Information Security, 11 (4), pp. 215-229; Davis, C.M., Tate, J.E., Okhravi, H., Grier, C., Overbye, T.J., Nicol, D., SCADA cyber security test bed development (2006) 38Th North American Power Symposium, NAPS, pp. 483-488. , Septembe 17–19, 2006; Bergman, D.C., Jin, D., Nicol, D.M., Yardley, T., The virtual power system test bed and inter-test bed integration (2009) Proceedings of the 2Nd Conference on Cyber Security Experimentation and Test (CSET 2009), p. 5. , USENIX Association, Berkeley; Giani, A., Karsai, G., Roosta, T., Shah, A., Sinopoli, B., Wiley, J., A test bed for secure and robust SCADA systems (2008) 14Th IEEE Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS 2008) WIP Session; Hong, J., Wu, S.-S., Stefanov, A., Fshosha, A., Liu, C.-C., Gladyshev, P., Govindarasu, M., An intrusion and defense test bed in a cyber-power system environment (2011) 2011 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting, pp. 1-5. , July 24–29; Dayal, A., Deng, Y., Tbaileh, A., Shukla, S., VSCADA: A reconfigurable virtual SCADA testbed for simulating power utility control center operations (2015) 2015 IEEE to Appear Power and Energy Society General Meeting, July 26–30; (2012), GE Intelligent Platforms, Proficy HMI/SCADA-iFIX, datasheet, GFA-562D; Lian, F.-L., Moyne, J.R., Tilbury, D.M., Performance evaluation of control networks: Ethernet, ControlNet, and DeviceNet (2001) IEEE Control Systems, 21 (1), pp. 66-83; Deng, Y., Lin, H., Shukla, S., Thorp, J., Mili, L., Co-simulating power systems and communication network for accurate modeling and simulation of PMU based wide area measurement systems using a global event scheduling technique (2013) 2013 Workshop on Modeling and Simulation of Cyber-Physical Energy Systems (MSCPES), pp. 1-6. , May 20–20; Siemens, Dynamic Simulation, White Paper, 02/2; Liu, Y., Reiter, M.K., Ning, P., False data injection attacks against state estimation in electric power grids (2009) Proc. 16Th ACM Conf.

Various algorithms have been proposed to obtain the location of sensor nodes. However, most of existing location algorithms assumes a non-adversarial environment. The position estimation accuracy decreases drastically when some of the sensor nodes are compromised. In this paper, we develop a secure localization scheme to resist the attack on the DV-Hop scheme, to mitigate the impact of such attacks. In our scheme, the flooding packets in the DV-Hop will be authenticated and the weight of beacon nodes will be used to abate the effect of nodes capture attack. Analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed can not only against nodes compromised attack effectively but also achieve comparable localization performance. © 2015 SERSC.",DV-Hop algorithm; Secure localization; Wireless sensor networks,Algorithms; Network security; Sensor nodes; Adversarial environments; Analysis and simulation; Dv-hop algorithms; Localization algorithm; Localization performance; Position estimation; Secure localization; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks,,,,,"Li, Z., Wireless sensor networks for energy and distance-based LEACH clustering algorithm (2012) International journal of advancements in computing technology., 4 (16), pp. 279-296; Arafeh, B., Day, K., Touzene, A., Alzeidi, N., Multipath grid-based enabled geographic routing for wireless sensor networks (2014) Wireless sensor network., 6 (12), pp. 265-276; Kułakowski, P., Vales-Alonso, J., Egea-López, E., Angle-of-arrival localization based on antenna arrays for wireless sensor networks (2010) Computers &electrical engineering., 36 (6), pp. 1181-1186; Zhao, B.B., Guan, X.X., Xie, L., Wendong, X., Sensor selection for received signal strength-based source localization in wireless sensor networks (2011) Journal of control theory and applications., 9 (1), pp. 51-57; Niculescu, D., Nath, B., Ad hoc positioning system (APS) (2001) Proceedings of 2001 IEEE global telecommunications conference., , November 25-29; San Antonio, TX, USA; Ma, D., Er, M.J., Wang, B., Hock, L., Range-free wireless sensor networks localization based on hop-count quantization (2012) Telecommunication systems., 50 (3), pp. 199-213; Winkler, T., Rinner, B., Security and privacy protection in visual sensor networks: A survey (2014) ACM computing surveys., 47 (1); Sun, F., Zhao, Z., Fang, Z., Du, L., Xu, Z., Chen, D., A review of attacks and security protocols for wireless sensor networks (2014) Journal of networks., 9 (5), pp. 1103-1113; Kumar, S., Lobiyal, D.K., An enhanced DV-Hop localization algorithm for wireless sensor networks (2012) International journal of wireless networks and broadband technologies (IJWNBT)., 2 (2), pp. 16-35; Kumar, S., Lobiyal, D.K., An advanced dv-hop localization algorithm for wireless sensor networks (2013) Wireless personal communications., 71 (2), pp. 1365-1385; Han, G., Chao, J., Zhang, C., Shu, L., Li, Q., The impacts of mobility models on DV-hop based localization in mobile wireless sensor networks (2014) Journal of network and computer applications., 42, pp. 70-79; Gui, L., Val, T., Wei, A., Dalce, R., Improvement of range-free localization technology by a novel DV-hop protocol in wireless sensor network (2015) Ad hoc networks., 25, pp. 55-73; Labraoui, N., Gueroui, M., Secure range-free localization scheme in wireless sensor networks (2011) Proceedings of IEEE the 10th international symposium on programming and systems (ISPS)., , April 25-27; Algiers, Algieria; Garg, R.R., Varna, A.L., Wu, M., An efficient gradient descent approach to secure localization in resource constrained wireless sensor networks (2012) IEEE transactions on information forensics and security., 7 (2), pp. 717-730; Han, G., Jiang, J., Shu, L., Mohsen, G., Shojiro, N., A two-step secure localization for wireless sensor networks (2013) The computer journal., 56 (10), pp. 1154-1166; He, J., Xu, J., Zhu, X., Reputation-based secure sensor localization in wireless sensor networks (2014) The scientific world journal.; Adrian Perrig, P., Robert, S., Tygar, J.D., Culler, D.E., SPINS: Security protocols for sensor networks (2002) Wireless networks., 5 (8), pp. 521-534","Yang, R.; College of Science, China; 电子邮件: xzhn_2008@163.com",,,Science and Engineering Research Support Society,,,,,17389976,,,,English,Int.

Despite their promising characteristics, CRNs also introduce new security threats, especially the internal attacks during the spectrum sensing and allocation process, which can degrade the efficiency of spectrum sensing and allocation. To address this issue, this paper proposes a distributed secure cooperative spectrum sensing strategy (DSCS) based on a dynamic reputation model to defend against attacks and provide reliable spectrum sensing. Moreover, the reputation values are used as weights in a novel distributed cheat-proof spectrum allocation strategy (DCSA) based on the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate that the proposed DSCS and DCSA strategies can provide an effective countermeasure against the internal spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attacks through enabling secondary users to obtain more accurate cooperative sensing results in adversarial environments. © 2015 Hui Lin et al.",,Network security;

In this presentation, various models of data protection and attacks are reviewed, followed by illustrations of how decision making can be integrated as two-party games, leading to unexpected “no attack” scenarios of data.

This chapter proposes a dynamic feature that is instrumental in achieving vulnerability assessment of a network of UAVs, whose control system is possibly affected by the diffusion of malware. The feature consists of the characterization of the transition from stability to instability with probability one. The stability of the networked UAVs can be indirectly affected by malicious attacks targeting the communication units or the control systems. The network is modeled as a discrete-time, jump, linear system whose state- space variables represent the probabilities that each node receives a malware and is infected by it. The stability analysis is obtained by means of a stochastic Lyapunov function argument and yields a sufficient condition expressed as a linear matrix inequality (LMI). This LMI involves the networked asset state- space matrices and the probability that each UAV’s control system is infected. An approximation to the sufficient condition is proposed so that convergence of the system trajectories could be monitored online. The proposed detection technique is validated by simulations of a UAV formation. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.",,Aircraft control; Computer crime; Control systems; Drones; Linear matrix inequalities; Linear systems; Lyapunov functions; Malware; Matrix algebra; Network security; Probability; Stability; Stochastic systems; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Adversarial environments; Health monitoring; Reliable operation; Situational awareness; Stability analysis; State-space matrices; Stochastic lyapunov functions; Vulnerability assessments; Networked control systems,,,,,"Adee, S., The hunt for the kill switch (2008) IEEE Spectrum, 45 (5), pp. 35-39; Basseville, M., Nikiforov, I.V., (1993) Detection of Abrupt Changes: Theory and Applications, , Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs; Bhattacharya, S., Başar, S., Game-theoretic analysis of an aerial jamming attack on a uav communication network Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference, p. 2010. , Baltimore, MD; Chakrabarti, D., Wang, Y., Wang, C., Leskovec, J., Faloutsos, C., Epidemic thresholds in real networks, acm trans (2008) Inf.

So, the problem of evaluating node and link importance in complex networks has been an active area of research in recent years. In this paper, we study Critical Node Importance(CNI) and Critical Link Importance(CLI) and put forward a new multi-criteria ranking method using the entropy-weighted method to evaluate CNI and CLI in complex networks. As is well known, most of existing methods only consider one factor (e.g. betweenness, degree), but not the integration of multiple factors in evaluating critical nodes and links, so each of those methods has a limited application range. We use the entropy-weighted method to evaluate the importance of each factor and obtain its weight. Then we compare our scheme with the manual-weighted method which set the weight of each factor randomly using several real networks. According to the evaluation results, our method has good performance on discrimination and precision to evaluate CNI and CLI. © 2015, Ubiquitous International.

The major issue of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) is to send data in secured manner from source to destination node in an adversarial (opponent) environment. Wireless networks are vulnerable to many attacks that are not secured and less-trustworthy. Existing research work focuses on developing the routing protocols for security enhancement in adversarial environment. These protocols are not secured in MANET environment. The existing protocol works on the basis of authentication, group signature, and onion routing. In this paper, the proposal of Trust based Anonymous Secure Routing for MANET in Adversarial environment is created to provide secured environment. TBASR protocol defends the neighbor nodes attacks by the way of key encryption and decryption through route-request and reply. Trust of the path is achieved by Asymmetric key encryption and that of the node is attained through group signature. It helps to detect intruders in the networks and avoids packet delay between intruder nodes. Onion Routing is used for obtaining anonymity during packet transmission. © Research India Publications.",Asymmetric key cryptography; Group signature; MANET; Onion Routing; Trust,,,,,,"Liu, W., Yu, M., AASR: Authenticated Anonymous Secure Routing for MANETs in Adversarial Environments (2014) IEEE transaction on Vehicular Technology, 63 (9); Gera, P., Garg, K., Misra, M., Trust-based Multi-Path Routing for Enhancing Data Security in MANETs (2014) International Journal of Network Security, 16 (2), pp. 102-111. , Mar; Sanzgiri, K., Dahill, B., Levine, B.N., Shields, C., Belding-Royer, E.M., A Secure Routing Protocol for Ad Hoc Networks (2002) Proceedings of the 10th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols: IEEE Computer Society; Kong, J., Hong, X., ANODR: ANonymous on demand routing with untraceable routes for mobile ad hoc networks (2003) Proc.

The major requirement is to provide non - matching and non - linking for mobile nodes and its traffics on the network. Although most of the anonymous secure routing protocols have been proposed system, but the requirements are not fully satisfied. The existing protocols are vulnerable to the attacks of fake routing packets broadcasting; even the node identities are protected. In this project we propose a new routing protocol called authenticated anonymous secure routing (AASR), to fulfill the requirement on the networks and to defend the attacks. The onion routing is used for key-encryption with a route secret verification message, is designed to prevent the nodes intermediate from inferring an actual destination.

It is difficult to provide trusted and secure communications in adversarial environments. The existing protocols are vulnerable to the attacks of fake routing packets and experiences more packet delay. To address these issues, in this paper a new protocol is been proposed i.e., Trust based Authenticated Anonymous Secure Routing (TAASR) protocol to reduce the packet delay. In this method, AASR combined it with a trust based Routing. Using the Trust model, the routing protocols can detect link failures, caused either by the mobility or adversary attacks. The proposed approach is an improvement over the existing technique and the simulation results of proposed technique reduces the packet delay. © Research India Publications.",Anonymous routing; Authentication; DoS attacks; Mobile ad hoc networks; Trust model,,,,,,"Liu, W., Yu, M., (2014) AASR Authenticated Anonymous Secure Routing for MANETs in Adversarial Environments, , March; Kelly, D., Raines, R., Baldwin, R., Mullins, B., Grimaila, M., Towards a taxonomy of wired and wireless anonymous Networks (2009) Proc.

The data can be purposely manipulated by humans to undermine their operation. Pattern classification systems may exhibit vulnerabilities, whose exploitation may severely affect their performance and limit their practical utility. Biometric authentication, network intrusion detection and spam filtering application are constructed with classification techniques. The security violation is divided into three types such as integrity violation, availability violation and privacy violation. An integrity violation, if it allows the adversary to access the service or resource protected by the classifier. An availability violation, if it denies legitimate users access to it. A privacy violation, if it allows the adversary to obtain confidential information from the classifier. Pattern classification techniques are extended with adversarial settings. Secure pattern classifiers are designed to control the performance degradation under potential attacks. Secure pattern classifier framework is built with model selection and training and testing data construction method. TR and TS construction algorithm is used to select data for pattern classifier. The proposed system is designed to enhance the secure pattern classifier with attack control mechanism. Training patterns are secured with simulated attack patterns. Pattern update process is monitored and controlled in testing process.

A seemingly fundamental limitation of the design process is that any new protocol only addresses the vulnerabilities detected in its predecessors, leaving the remaining vulnerabilities unaffected. Hence, the design process amounts to an arms race between more sophisticated attacks and protocol fixes. To change this situation, a framework is needed for secure protocol design that offers provable performance and security guarantees against all possible attacks on the network. This monograph proposes such a framework, contingent on some underlying model assumptions. The framework consists of a game defined between protocols and adversarial strategies in which the adversarial strategy is selected after the protocol has been revealed to all of the nodes. Each choice of protocol and adversarial strategy results in a payoff that corresponds to the functionality retained by the network, despite the adversarial activity. The design imperative is to choose the protocol that maximizes this payoff. Two scenarios are considered: networks in which the nodes are initially synchronized and unsynchronized respectively. In each scenario, a protocol is described and three results are proved. First, the protocol is max-min optimal with respect to the payoff. The max-min payoff is the best that can be achieved because the protocol is always known to the adversarial nodes before the adversarial strategy is chosen. Second, the protocol is min-max optimal; there is a Nash equilibrium in the space of protocols and adversarial strategies. By implication, the adversarial nodes gain no strategic advantage from knowing protocol a priori. Finally, the adversarial nodes are effectively confined to one of two behavior modes: either jam or conform to the protocol, neither of which can be prevented by any protocol. © 2015 J.

While the technological progress in all domains of Estonian society is astounding, it has also created an immense cyber threat for the nation. With the advent of information systems and infrastructure to support these numerous services has come the immense increase in the attack surface for any cyber adversary or attack. In response to this, this report is dedicated to analyzing Estonia's cyber security strategy, policy and capabilities in efforts to assess Estonia's ability to effectively mitigate and defend against cyber attacks and adversaries to their information services, systems and infrastructure as well as their realized digital way of life. It is initially hypothesized that Estonia does maintain significant technical and strategic capabilities to thwart possible threats via the cyber domain but does not possess the equivalent in operational resources in order to implement such capabilities. The analysis concludes that Estonian leadership is very aware of this and understands the threats and possible consequences in establishing such avocation of information and communication technologies. Additionally, there is substantial evidence to support that Estonia has the technical capabilities and strategic acumen to effectively defend against adversarial forces targeting their information services, systems and infrastructure; while there was not sufficient proof of resources required to implement and fully utilize these capabilities.",Critical infrastructure; Cyber policy; Cyber security; Estonia; National defence,Critical infrastructures;

They are characterized by a complex structure and their variety is considerably high. Several solutions have been academically developed to mitigate such attacks. However, they leveraged on information that were extracted from either only the structure or the content of the PDF file. This creates problems when trying to detect non-Javascript or targeted attacks. In this paper, we present a novel machine learning system for the automatic detection of malicious PDF documents. It extracts information from both the structure and the content of the PDF file, and it features an advanced parsing mechanism. In this way, it is possible to detect a wide variety of attacks, including non-Javascript and parsing-based ones. Moreover, with a careful choice of the learning algorithm, our approach provides a significantly higher accuracy compared to other static analysis techniques, especially in the presence of adversarial malware manipulation.",Adversarial machine learning; Evasion; Javascript; Malware; PDF,High level languages; Information systems; Information use; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Network security; Static analysis; Analysis techniques; Automatic Detection; Complex structure; Content-based approach; Evasion; Javascript; Modern computer systems; Robust detection; Malware,,,,,"(2006) PDF Reference.

While a number of adversary-aware learning algorithms have been proposed, they are computationally demanding and aim to counter specific kinds of adversarial data manipulation. In this work, we overcome these limitations by proposing a multiple classifier system capable of improving security against evasion attacks at test time by learning a decision function that more tightly encloses the legitimate samples in feature space, without significantly compromising accuracy in the absence of attack. Since we combine a set of one-class and two-class classifiers to this end, we name our approach one-and-a-halfclass (1.5C) classification. Our proposal is general and it can be used to improve the security of any classifier against evasion attacks at test time, as shown by the reported experiments on spam and malware detection. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,Computer crime; Internet; Learning algorithms; Mobile security; Data manipulations; Decision functions; Feature space; Malware detection; Multiple classifier systems; Pattern classifier; Test time; Two-class classifier; Malware,,,,,"Dalvi, N., Domingos, P., Mausam, S.S., Verma, D., Adversarial classification (2004) 10Th International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining.

When a pattern classifier is employed in adversarial environments like spam filtering, biometric authentication and network intrusion detection, the performance and utility of the application will diminish when it frails under attack. In this work, for effective classification an enhanced method is proposed to ensure the officiation of classifier against attacks. To manifest this model, they are accustomed in adversarial application and performances of two classifiers namely SVM and LR are measured under simulated attack. From our experiments it is evident that LR classier has high accuracy in predicting the attacks than SVM. © 2015 P. Udhaya and G.

The increasing prominence of this technique, combined with its introduction as evidence in the court, brought with it the need for it to withstand anti-forensics. Although robustness under common signal processing operations and geometrical transformations have been considered as potential attacks on this technique, new adversarial settings that curtail the performance of this technique are constantly being introduced. Starting with an overview of proposed approaches to counter PRNU based source attribution, this work introduces photographic panoramas as one such approach and discusses how to defend against it. © 2015 SPIE.",adaptive prnu denoising; counter-forensics; forensics; geometric transformations; panoramic-imaging; photo-response-non-uniformity; seam-carving; Source camera identification,Mathematical transformations; Counter-Forensics; De-noising; forensics; Geometric transformations; Panoramic imaging; Photo response non-uniformity; Seam carving; Source camera identifications; Signal processing,,,,,"Lukáš, J., Fridrich, J., Goljan, M., Digital camera identification from sensor pattern noise (2006) IEEE T.

We argue that game theory provides an important theoretical framework for reasoning about information manipulation in adversarial settings, including deception and randomization strategies. In addition, game theory has practical uses in determining optimal strategies for randomized patrolling and resource allocation.We discuss three game-theoretic models that capture aspects of how honeypots can be used in network security. Honeypots are fake hosts introduced into a network to gather information about attackers and to distract them from real targets. They are a limited resource, so there are important strategic questions about how to deploy them to the greatest effect, which is fundamentally about deceiving attackers into choosing fake targets instead of real ones to attack.We describe several game models that address strategies for deploying honeypots, including a basic honeypot selection game, an extension of this game that allows additional probing actions by the attacker, and finally a version in which attacker strategies are represented using attack graphs. We conclude with a discussion of the strengths and limitations of game theory in the context of network security. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,,,,,,"Bosansky, B., Kiekintveld, C., Lisy, V., Cermak, J., Pechoucek, M., Double-oracle algorithm for computing an exact nash equilibrium in zero-sum extensive-form games (2013) Proceedings of the 12Th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2013); Buldas, A., Stepanenko, R., Upper bounds for adversaries’ utility in attack trees (2012) <ref-sourcetitle type=""edbook""></ref-sourcetitle>, pp. 98-117. , In J.

In this study, we consider a representative collection of behavioral biometrics: two low-level modalities of keystroke dynamics and mouse movement, and a high-level modality of stylometry. We develop a sensor for each modality and organize the sensors as a parallel binary decision fusion architecture. We consider several applications for this authentication system, with a particular focus on secure distributed communication. We test our approach on a dataset collected from 67 users, each working individually in an office environment for a period of approximately one week. We are able to characterize the performance of the system with respect to intruder detection time and robustness to adversarial attacks, and to quantify the contribution of each modality to the overall performance. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It is possible to derive properties of the overall attacks from properties of individual steps, such as cost for the attacker and probability of success. However, in existing formalisms, such properties are considered independent. For example, investing more in an attack step would not increase the probability of success. As this seems counterintuitive, we introduce a framework for reasoning about attack trees based on the notion of control strength, annotating nodes with a function from attacker investment to probability of success. Calculation rules on such trees are defined to enable analysis of optimal attacker investment. Our second result consists of the translation of optimal attacker investment into the associated adversarial risk, yielding what we call adversarial risk trees. The third result is the introduction of probabilistic attacker strategies, based on the fitness (utility) of available scenarios. Together these contributions improve the possibilities for using attack trees in adversarial risk analysis. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",Adversarial risk analysis; Attack trees; Attacker models; Control strength; Fitness functions; Security metrics; Simulation,Computer privacy; Data privacy; Forestry; Investments; Probability; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risks; Adversarial risk analysis; Attack tree; Attacker models; Fitness functions; Security metrics; Simulation; Security of data; Algorithms; Probability; Risk Assessment; Simulation,,,,,"Arnold, F., Hermanns, H., Pulungan, R., Stoelinga, M., Time-dependent analysis of attacks (2014) POST 2014 (ETAPS 2014), 8414, pp. 285-305. , Abadi, M., Kremer, S.

The paper starts with a brief introduction to the OFDM waveform and then reviews the robustness of the existing OFDM waveform in the presence of noise, multipath fading, and interference. The paper then moves on to build comprehensive adversarial models against OFDM waveforms. Robustness of OFDM is first investigated under AWGN noise and noise-like jamming attack scenarios, then under uncorrelated yet colored interferences from modulated sources (both intentional and unintentional). Finally, the paper explores some of the more recent developments in the field of energy efficient correlated jamming attacks that can disrupt communication severely by exploiting the knowledge of the target waveform structure. Potential countermeasures against such jamming attacks are presented, in an attempt to make a robust and resilient OFDM waveform. © 1998-2012 IEEE.",anti-jamming; Jamming; LTE; MIMO; OFDM; robustness; security; TV white space; WIMAX,Energy efficiency; Frequency division multiplexing; Jamming; Local area networks; Long Term Evolution (LTE); MIMO systems; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network layers; Physical addresses; Robustness (control systems); Wimax; Wireless telecommunication systems; 3gpp long term evolutions; Anti-jamming; LTE; Physical layer security; security; Tv white spaces; Waveform structure; Wireless broadband; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing,,,,,"(2010) Connecting America: The National Broadband Plan; (2007) FCC Band Plan on Public Safety Spectrum at 700 MHz, , FCC,WT Docket No. 06-150, Aug; Clancy, T.C., Efficient OFDM denial: Pilot jamming and pilot nulling Proc.

In this work we explore the security of Inner Product Functional Encryption schemes with the goal of achieving the highest security against practically feasible attacks. While there has been substantial research effort in defining meaningful security models for FE, known definitions run into one of the following difficulties – if general and strong, the definition can be shown impossible to achieve, whereas achievable definitions necessarily restrict the usage scenarios in which FE schemes can be deployed. We argue that it is extremely hard to control the nature of usage scenarios that may arise in practice. Any cryptographic scheme may be deployed in an arbitrarily complex environment and it is vital to have meaningful security guarantees for general scenarios. Hence, in this work, we examine whether it is possible to analyze the security of FE in a wider variety of usage scenarios, but with respect to a meaningful class of adversarial attacks known to be possible in practice. Note that known impossibilities necessitate that we must either restrict the usage scenarios (as done in previous works), or the class of attacks (this work). We study real world loss-of-secrecy attacks against Functional Encryption for Inner Product predicates constructed over elliptic curve groups. Our main contributions are as follows: – We capture a large variety of possible usage scenarios that may arise in practice by providing a stronger, more general, intuitive framework that supports function privacy in addition to data privacy, and a separate encryption key in addition to public key and master secret key. These generalizations allow our framework to capture program obfuscation as a special case of functional encryption, and allows for a separation between users that encrypt data, access data and produce secret keys. – We note that the landscape of attacks over pairing-friendly elliptic curves have been the subject of extensive research and there now exist constructions of pairing-friendly elliptic curves where the complexity of all known non-generic attacks is (far) greater than the complexity of generic attacks. Thus, by appropriate choice of the underlying elliptic curve, we can capture all known practically feasible attacks on secrecy by restricting our attention to generic attacks. – We construct a new inner product FE scheme using prime order groups and show it secure under our new, hitherto strongest known framework in the generic group model, thus ruling out all generic attacks in arbitrarily complex real world environments. Since our construction is over prime order groups, we rule out factoring attacks that typically force higher security parameters. Our concrete-analysis proofs provide guidance on the size of elliptic curve groups that are needed for explicit complexity bounds on the attacker. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2015.",Functional Encryption; Generic attacks; Inner-product encryption; Pairing based cryptography; Practical security; Simulation based security,Access control; Cryptography; Data privacy; Geometry; Mobile security; Public key cryptography; Functional encryptions; Generic attacks; Inner product; Pairing-based cryptography; Practical security; Simulation-based security; Security of data,,,,,"http://www.voltage.com/; Agrawal, S., Agrawal, S., Prabhakaran, M., (2015) Cryptographic Agents: Towards a Unified Theory of Computing on Encrypted Data, , In: To appear in Eurocrypt 2015; Agrawal, S., Boneh, D., Boyen, X., Efficient lattice (H)IBE in the standard model (2010) EUROCRYPT 2010.

This discovery initialized a line of research dealing with two different types of tokens. Using only a single stateful token, one can implement general statistically secure two-party computation (Döttling, Kraschewski, Müller-Quade; TCC 2011); though all security is lost if an adversarial token receiver manages to physically reset and rerun the token. Stateless tokens, which are secure by definition against any such resetting-attacks, however, do provably not suffice for statistically secure computation in general (Goyal, Ishai, Mahmoody, Sahai; CRYPTO 2010). We investigate the natural question of what is possible if an adversary can reset a token at most a bounded number of times (e.g., because each resetting attempt imposes a significant risk to trigger a self-destruction mechanism of the token). Somewhat surprisingly, our results come close to the known positive results with respect to non-resettable stateful tokens. In particular, we construct polynomially many instances of statistically secure and universally composable oblivious transfer, using only a constant number of tokens. Our techniques have some abstract similarities to previous solutions, which we grasp by defining a new security property for protocols that use oracle access. Additionally, we apply our techniques to zero-knowledge proofs and obtain a protocol that achieves the same properties as bounded-query zero-knowledge PCPs (Kilian, Petrank, Tardos; STOC 1997), even if a malicious prover may issue stateful PCP oracles. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2015.",,Computation theory; Cryptography; Hardware tokens; Oblivious transfer; Secure computation; Secure two-party computations; Security properties; Universally composable; Zero knowledge; Zero knowledge proof; Hardware security,,,,,"Arora, S., Safra, S., Probabilistic checking of proofs; A new characterization of NP (1992) Foundations of Computer Science-Proceedings of FOCS 1992, pp. 2-13. , IEEE Computer Society; Barak, B., Goldreich, O., Goldwasser, S., Lindell, Y., Resettably-sound zeroknowledge and its applications (2001) Foundations of Computer Science-Proceedings of FOCS 2001, pp. 116-125. , IEEE Computer Society; Barak, B., Lindell, Y., Vadhan, S.P., Lower bounds for non-black-box zero knowledge (2006) J.

To this end, we introduce the two-tier model for MPC, where some small subset of servers is guaranteed to be honest at the beginning of the computation (the first tier), while the corruption state of the other servers (the second tier) is unknown. The two-tier model naturally arises in various settings, such as for example when a service provider wishes to utilize a large pre-existing set of servers, while being able to trust only a small fraction of them. The first tier is responsible for performing the secure computation while the second tier serves as a disguise: using novel anonymization techniques, servers in the first tier remain undetected to an adaptive adversary, preventing a targeted attack on these critical servers. Specifically, given n servers and assuming αn of them are corrupt at the onset (where α ∈ (0, 1)), we present an MPC protocol that can withstand an optimal amount of less than (1−α)n/2 additional adaptive corruptions, provided the first tier is of size ω(log n). This allows us to perform MPC in a fully secure manner even when the total number of corruptions exceeds n/2 across both tiers, thus evading the honest majority requirement. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2015.",,Cryptography; Adaptive adversary; Adaptive corruptions; Anonymization; Fully secure; Secure computation; Secure multi-party computation; Service provider; Two-tier models; Computation theory,,,,,"Abe, M., Fehr, S., Adaptively secure Feldman VSS and applications to universally-composable threshold cryptography (2004) CRYPTO 2004.

Currently deployed ZIA solutions are predominantly based on the terminal detecting the proximity of the user's personal device, or a security token, by running an authentication protocol over a short-range wireless communication channel. Unfortunately, this simple approach is highly vulnerable to low-cost and practical relay attacks which completely offset the usability benefits of ZIA. The use of contextual information, gathered via on-board sensors, to detect the co-presence of the user and the verifier is a recently proposed mechanism to resist relay attacks. In this paper, we systematically investigate the performance of different sensor modalities for co-presence detection with respect to a standard Dolev-Yao adversary. First, using a common data collection framework run in realistic everyday settings, we compare the performance of four commonly available sensor modalities (WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, and audio) in resisting ZIA relay attacks, and find that WiFi is better than the rest. Second, we show that, compared to any single modality, fusing multiple modalities improves resilience against ZIA relay attacks while retaining a high level of usability. Third, we motivate the need for a stronger adversarial model to characterize an attacker who can compromise the integrity of context sensing itself. We show that in the presence of such a powerful attacker, each individual sensor modality offers very low security. Positively, the use of multiple sensor modalities improves security against such an attacker if the attacker cannot compromise multiple modalities simultaneously. Finally, based on our analysis, we integrate our contextual co-presence detection system with a real-world ZIA application, BlueProximity [1], so as to enhance its security against relay attacks. We describe the design of the BlueProximity++ application and present results from a small-scale user study that evaluated its effectiveness. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To respond actively against these malicious codes, analysts employ automated investigation tools on the malware. However, there has been advent of malware employing the various techniques to avoid the detection of the SandBox, which makes hard to identify the adversarial behaviors of the samples codes. In this paper, we propose efficient methods to trigger adversarial behaviors from the sample codes during virtual execution in the Sandbox in order to perform the analysis of malware. © 2015 SERSC.",Anti-debugging; Anti-vm; Malicious behavior; Malicious code; Sandbox,Codes (symbols); Computer crime; Anti-debugging; Anti-vm; Malicious behavior; Malicious codes; Sandbox; Malware,,,,,"Lu, H., Wang, X., Su, J., CS: Collaborative Malware Clustering and Signature Generation using Malware Behavioral Analysis (2012) IJHIT, 5 (2), pp. 147-152. , April; Fireeye, Hot Knives through Butter: Evading File-based Sandboxes (2013), August; Christodorescu, M., Jha, S., Static analysis of executables to detect malicious patterns (2003), pp. 169-186. , 12th Usenix Security Symposium; Bellard, F., QEMU - a fast and portable dynamic translator (2005) Proceedings of the annual conference on USENIX Annual Technical Conference, pp. 41-46. , April 10-15, Anaheim, CA; Xie, P., Lu, X., Wang, Y., Su, J., Eliminate Evading Analysis Tricks in Malware using Dynamic Slicing (2013) IJSIA, 7 (3), pp. 357-366. , May; Willems, C., Holz, T., Freiling, F., Toward automated dynamic malware analysis using cwsandbox (2007) IEEE Security and Privacy, 5, pp. 32-39; http://zerowine.sourceforge.net/, ZeroWine; https://anubis.iseclab.org/, Anubis; http://www.cuckoosandbox.org/, Cuckoo Sandbox; Elhadi, A.A.E., Maarof, M.A., Barry, B.I.A., Improving the Detection of Malware Behaviour Using Simplified Data Dependent API Call Graph (2013) IJSIA, 7 (5), pp. 29-42. , September; Fireeye, (2012), Don't Click the Left Mouse Button: Introducing Trojan UpClicker, December; BaneChant: In-Memory Trojan That Observes for Multiple Mouse Clicks (2013), BaneChant, Trojan.APT, April; Godefroid, P., Levin, M.Y., Molnar, D., Automated Whitebox Fuzz Testing (2008) NDSS, 8; Pasareanu, C., Visser, W., A survey of new trends in symbolic execution for software testing and analysis (2009) ICSE","Joo, J.-U.; Interdisciplinary Program of Information and Protection, Mokpo National UniversitySouth Korea",,,Science and Engineering Research Support Society,,,,,17389976,,,,English,Int.

Such embedded systems operate in the presence of inherent uncertainty, context dependencies and adversarial certainty arising from both the cyber and physical worlds. Security is one of the key concepts to shield the CPS environment and different embedding devices in order to have a reliable and secure communication platform. There are many security approaches and methods proposed and implemented globally in order to secure CPS, along with areas such as social engineering, security standards, vendor control, as well as access control implementation, etc. However, in addition to these areas, another important concept, namely trust, is significant in ensuring secure and reliable communications in CPS. In the current state-of-the-art, none of the existing approaches discusses the issue of a secure, trust-based CPS. Thus, to address this shortcoming, in this paper, a two-tier blanket approach is proposed consisting of internal and external layers of trust among different entities to create reliable and secure CPS. This trust-based framework improves the confidence of secure entities joining the CPS system and also builds relationships among entities, thereby increasing the security protecting the formed CPS from outside threats and attacks. © 2005 - 2015 JATIT & LLS.

These intrusions (or attacks) are modeled as outliers (or noise) within a principled probabilistic framework. The proposed framework is based on finite Gaussian mixtures and allows the detection of both previously seen and unknown attacks against web services. The main idea of our framework is based on the consideration of malicious requests as outliers within our finite mixture model. Using this idea the intrusion detection problem is reduced to an adversarial classification problem. The merits of the proposed approach are shown using a data set containing both normal and intrusive requests, which were collected from a large real-life web service. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",Intrusion detection; mixture model; outlier detection; unsupervised learning; Web service,Intrusion detection; Statistics; Systems engineering; Unsupervised learning; Web services; Adversarial classifications; Data set; Finite Gaussian mixtures; Finite mixture modeling; Mixture model; Outlier Detection; Probabilistic framework; Unknown attacks; Websites,,,,,"Barnett, V., Lewis, T., (1994) Outliers in Statistical Data., , John Wiley & Sons; Bouguila, N., Ziou, D., Dirichlet-based probability model applied to human skin detection (2004) Proc. of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP)., pp. 521-524. , In; Bouguila, N., Ziou, D., A powerful finite mixture model based on the generalized Dirichlet distribution: Unsupervised learning and applications (2004) Proc. of the 17th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)., pp. 280-283. , In; Bouguila, N., Almakadmeh, K., Boutemedjet, S., A finite mixture model for simultaneous high-dimensional clustering, localized feature selection and outlier rejection (2012) Expert Systems with Applications, 39 (7), pp. 6641-6656; Bouguila, N., Ziou, D., Using unsupervised learning of a finite dirichlet mixture model to improve pattern recognition applications (2005) Pattern Recognition Letters, 26 (12), pp. 1916-1925; Bouguila, N., Ziou, D., Unsupervised selection of a finite dirichlet mixture model: An mml-based approach (2006) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 18 (8), pp. 993-1009; Chan, P.K., Lippmann, R., Machine learning for computer security (2006) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 6, pp. 2669-2672; Corona, I., Giacinto, G., Detection of server-side web attacks (2010) JMLR Proceedings, 11, pp. 160-166. , In: Diethe, T., Cristianini, N., Shawe-Taylor, J.
