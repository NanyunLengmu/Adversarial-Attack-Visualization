In recent years, machine learning-based systems have been successfully deployed in malware detection, in which different kinds of classifiers are built based on the training samples using different feature representations. Unfortunately, as classifiers become more widely deployed, the incentive for defeating them increases. In this paper, we explore the adversarial machine learning in malware detection. In particular, on the basis of a learning-based classifier with the input of Windows Application Programming Interface (API) calls extracted from the Portable Executable (PE) files, we present an effective evasion attack model (named EvnAttack) by considering different contributions of the features to the classification problem. To be resilient against the evasion attack, we further propose a secure-learning paradigm for malware detection (named SecDefender), which not only adopts classifier retraining technique but also introduces the security regularization term which considers the evasion cost of feature manipulations by attackers to enhance the system security. Comprehensive experimental results on the real sample collections from Comodo Cloud Security Center demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. © 2017 IEEE.",Adversarial machine learning; Evasion attack and defense; Malware detection,Application programming interfaces (API); Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Computer crime; Damage detection; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Network security; Evasion attack and defense; Feature representation; Learning paradigms; Malware detection; Portable Executable files; Regularization terms; Retraining technique; Windows application; Malware,,,,,"Bailey, M., Oberheide, J., Andersen, J., Mao, Z.M., Jahanian, F., Nazario, J., Automated classification and analysis of internet malware (2007) RAID '07, pp. 178-197; Baldangombo, U., Jambaljav, N., Horng, S.-J., A static malware detection system using data mining methods (2013) CoRR Journal; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., The security of machine learning (2010) Machine Learning; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., Can machine learning be secure?

Our construction suggests some insights into how deep networks work. We provide a reasonable analyses that our construction is difficult to defeat, and show experimentally that our method is hard to defeat with both Type I and Type II attacks using several standard networks and datasets. This SafetyNet architecture is used to an important and novel application SceneProof, which can reliably detect whether an image is a picture of a real scene or not. SceneProof applies to images captured with depth maps (RGBD images) and checks if a pair of image and depth map is consistent. It relies on the relative difficulty of producing naturalistic depth maps for images in post processing. We demonstrate that our SafetyNet is robust to adversarial examples built from currently known attacking approaches. © 2017 IEEE.",,Computer science; Computers; Electrical engineering; Depth Map; Novel applications; Post processing; SafetyNet; Type II; Computer vision,,,,,"Butler, D.J., Wulff, J., Stanley, G.B., Black, M.J., A naturalistic open source movie for optical flow evaluation (2012) European Conf. on Computer Vision (ECCV), Part IV, LNCS, 7577, pp. 611-625. , Springer-Verlag, Oct.

In this paper, we extend adversarial examples to semantic segmentation and object detection which are much more difficult. Our observation is that both segmentation and detection are based on classifying multiple targets on an image (e.g., the target is a pixel or a receptive field in segmentation, and an object proposal in detection). This inspires us to optimize a loss function over a set of targets for generating adversarial perturbations. Based on this, we propose a novel algorithm named Dense Adversary Generation (DAG), which applies to the state-of-the-art networks for segmentation and detection. We find that the adversarial perturbations can be transferred across networks with different training data, based on different architectures, and even for different recognition tasks. In particular, the transfer ability across networks with the same architecture is more significant than in other cases.

These perturbations denote noise added to the input that was generated specifically to fool the system while being quasi-imperceptible for humans. More severely, there even exist universal perturbations that are input-agnostic but fool the network on the majority of inputs. While recent work has focused on image classification, this work proposes attacks against semantic image segmentation: we present an approach for generating (universal) adversarial perturbations that make the network yield a desired target segmentation as output. We show empirically that there exist barely perceptible universal noise patterns which result in nearly the same predicted segmentation for arbitrary inputs. Furthermore, we also show the existence of universal noise which removes a target class (e.g., all pedestrians) from the segmentation while leaving the segmentation mostly unchanged otherwise. © 2017 IEEE.",,Computer vision; Deep learning; Semantics; Arbitrary inputs; Noise patterns; Semantic image segmentations; Target class; Target segmentation; Image segmentation,,,,,"Brostow, G.J., Fauqueur, J., Cipolla, R., Semantic object classes in video: A high-definition ground truth database (2009) Pattern Recognition Letters, 30 (2), pp. 88-97. , Jan; Carlini, N., Wagner, D., (2016) Towards Evaluating the Robustness of Neural Networks, , arXiv:1608. 04644, Aug; Chen, L.-C., Papandreou, G., Kokkinos, I., Murphy, K., Yuille, A.L., Semantic image segmentation with deep convolutional nets and fully connected crfs (2015) International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR); Chen, L.-C., Yang, Y., Wang, J., Xu, W., Yuille, A.L., Attention to scale: Scale-aware semantic image segmentation (2016) Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR); Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., Enzweiler, M., Benenson, R., Franke, U., Schiele, B., The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding (2016) Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), , Las Vegas, Nevada, USA; Fawzi, A., Moosavi-Dezfooli, S.-M., Frossard, P., Robustness of classifiers: From adversarial to random noise (2016) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 29, pp. 1632-1640. , D.

However, recent research has shown that there exist many adversarial examples that can negatively impact the performance of such an architecture. This paper focuses on detecting those adversarial examples by analyzing whether they come from the same distribution as the normal examples. Instead of directly training a deep neural network to detect adversarials, a much simpler approach was proposed based on statistics on outputs from convolutional layers. A cascade classifier was designed to efficiently detect adversarials. Furthermore, trained from one particular adversarial generating mechanism, the resulting classifier can successfully detect adversarials from a completely different mechanism as well. The resulting classifier is non-subdifferentiable, hence creates a difficulty for adversaries to attack by using the gradient of the classifier. After detecting adversarial examples, we show that many of them can be recovered by simply performing a small average filter on the image. Those findings should lead to more insights about the classification mechanisms in deep convolutional neural networks. © 2017 IEEE.",,Bandpass filters; Classification (of information); Computer vision;

Multi-UAV networks face various security issues because of being a member of an Adhoc network family. There is a dire need to design a threat model that can identify threats, quantify risks involved and address them. In this paper, a novel threat model for Multi-UAV Adhoc networks is proposed. The proposed model considers adversarial capabilities, environmental, targets, and vulnerable domains of Multi-UAV Adhoc networks. Furthermore, the risk analysis and classification of attacks is done based on their influence on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. © 2017 IEEE.",Adhoc Networks; Multi-UAV; Security; Threat model; UAVs; Vulnerability,Ad hoc networks; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Military operations; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Disaster management; Multi UAV; Security; Security issues; Threat modeling; Vulnerability; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV),,,,,"Chao, H., Cao, Y., Chen, Y., Autopilots for small unmanned aerial vehicles: A survey (2010) International Journal of Control, Automation and Systems, 8 (1), pp. 36-44. , Feb 1; Singh, K., Verma, A.K., Flying adhoc networks concept and challenges (2018) Encyclopedia of Information Science and Technology, pp. 6106-6113. , Fourth Edition.

However, a more realistic attack is essentially an attack with limited adversarial knowledge of the system model and limited attack resources due to various reasons. In this paper, we generalize the data attacks that they can be pure FDI attacks or combined with availability attacks (e.g., DoS attacks) and analyze the attacks with limited adversarial knowledge or limited attack resources. The attack impact is evaluated by the proposed metrics and the detection probability of attacks is calculated using the distribution property of data with or without attacks. The analysis is supported with results from a power system use case. The results show how important the knowledge is to the attacker and which measurements are more vulnerable to attacks with limited resources. © 2017 IEEE.",,Denial-of-service attack; Probability distributions; Bad data detections; Coordinate measurements; Data integrity attacks; Detection probabilities; Distribution property; False data injection; Power system state estimation; System modeling; Industrial electronics,,,,,"Teixeira, A., Amin, S., Sandberg, H., Johansson, K.H., Sastry, S.S., Cyber security analysis of state estimators in electric power systems (2010) Proc. 49th IEEE Conf.

The security of DNN itself is therefore of great concern. In this paper, we investigate the impact of fault injection attacks on DNN, wherein attackers try to misclassify a specified input pattern into an adversarial class by modifying the parameters used in DNN via fault injection. We propose two kinds of fault injection attacks to achieve this objective. Without considering stealthiness of the attack, single bias attack (SBA) only requires to modify one parameter in DNN for misclassification, based on the observation that the outputs of DNN may linearly depend on some parameters. Gradient descent attack (GDA) takes stealthiness into consideration. By controlling the amount of modification to DNN parameters, GDA is able to minimize the fault injection impact on input patterns other than the specified one. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attacks. © 2017 IEEE.",Fault injection; Misclassification; Neural network,Classification (of information); Computer aided design; Hardware security; Network security; Neural networks; Software testing; Classification results; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Fault injection; Fault injection attacks; Gradient descent; Highly accurate; Misclassifications; Mission critical systems; Deep neural networks,,,,,"Dahl, G.E., Large-scale malware classification using random projections and neural networks (2013) Proc. of International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP); Ciresan, D.C., Multi-column deep neural network for traffic sign classification (2012) Neural Networks; Taigman, Y., Deepface: Closing the gap to human-level performance in face verification (2014) Proc. of Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR); Szegedy, C., (2013) Intriguing Properties of Neural Networks; Goodfellow, I.J., (2014) Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples; Papernot, N., Distillation as a defense to adversarial perturbations against deep neural networks (2016) Proc. of Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP); Gu, S., Rigazio, L., (2014) Towards Deep Neural Network Architectures Robust to Adversarial Examples; Bergstra, J., Theano: A CPU and GPU math compiler in python (2010) Proc. of Python in Science Conf; Chen, T., Diannao: A small-footprint high-throughput accelerator for ubiquitous machine-learning (2014) Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems (ASPLOS); Barenghi, A., Fault injection attacks on cryptographic devices: Theory, practice, and countermeasures (2012) Proc. of the IEEE; Selmke, B., Precise laser fault injections into 90 nm and 45 nm SRAM-cells (2015) Proc. of Smart Card Research and Advanced Applications (CARDIS); Agoyan, M., How to flip a bit?

As consequence, offering private Web search functionalities is essential to the users who care about their privacy. Nowadays, there exists no satisfactory approach to enable users to access search engines in a privacy-preserving way. Existing solutions are either too costly due to the heavy use of cryptographic mechanisms (e.g., private information retrieval protocols), subject to attacks (e.g., Tor, TrackMeNot, GooPIR) or rely on weak adversarial models (e.g., PEAS). This paper introduces X-Search, a novel private Web search mechanism building on the disruptive Software Guard Extensions (SGX) proposed by Intel. We compare X-Search to its closest competitors, Tor and PEAS, using a dataset of real web search queries. Our evaluation shows that: (1) X-Search offers stronger privacy guarantees than its competitors as it operates under a stronger adversarial model; (2) it better resists state-of-the-art re-identification attacks; and (3) from the performance perspective, X-Search outperforms its competitors both in terms of latency and throughput by orders of magnitude. © 2017 ACM.",Middleware; Privacy; Security; SGX; Web search,Data privacy; Information retrieval; Middleware; Network security; Search engines; Economic modeling; Orders of magnitude; Privacy preserving; Private information retrieval protocols; Re identifications; Security; Web search queries; Web searches; Websites,,,,,"http://ark.intel.com/products/88196/Intel-Core-i7-6700-Processor-8M-Cache-up-to-4_00-GHz, Accessed on 12/03/2017.

In this work, we present a statistical analysis of the impact of adversarial evasion attacks on various linear and non-linear classifiers, using a recently proposed Android malware classifier as a case study. We systematically explore the complete space of possible attacks varying in the adversary's knowledge about the classifier; our results show that it is possible to subvert linear classifiers (Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression) by perturbing only a few features of malicious apps, with more knowledgeable adversaries degrading the classifier's detection rate from 100% to 0% and a completely blind adversary able to lower it to 12%. We show non-linear classifiers (Random Forest and Neural Network) to be more resilient to these attacks. We conclude our study with recommendations for designing classifiers to be more robust to the attacks presented in our work. © 2017 IEEE.",,Android (operating system); Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Decision trees; Learning systems; Vector spaces; Android malware; Detection rates; Linear classifiers; Logistic regressions; Nonlinear classifiers; On-machines; Random forests; User devices; Malware,,,,,"(2017), https://androzoo.uni.lu/, [Online; accessed 12-Sep-2017]; (2017) International Data Corporation Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, , http://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/os, Online; accessed 12-Sep-2017; (2017) Project Kharon: Studying Android Malware Behaviours, , http://kharon.gforge.inria.fr/, [Online; accessed 12-Sep-2017]; (2017) Scikit Learn: Machine Learning in Python, , http://scikit-learn.org, Online; accessed 12-Sep-2017; (2017), https://virustotal.com/, [Online; accessed 12-Sep-2017]; Arp, D., Spreitzenbarth, M., Hubner, M., Gascon, H., Rieck, K., Siemens, C., Drebin: Effective and explainable detection of Android malware in your pocket (2014) NDSS; Chen, S., Xue, M., Xu, L., Towards adversarial detection of mobile malware: Poster (2016) Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking, pp. 415-416. , ACM; Corona, I., Giacinto, G., Roli, F., Adversarial attacks against intrusion detection systems: Taxonomy, solutions and open issues (2013) Information Sciences, 239, pp. 201-225; Demontis, A., Melis, M., Biggio, B., Maiorca, D., Arp, D., Rieck, K., Corona, I., Roli, F., Yes, machine learning can be more secure! a case study on android malware detection (2017) IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing; Faruki, P., Bharmal, A., Laxmi, V., Ganmoor, V., Gaur, M.S., Conti, M., Rajarajan, M., Android security: A survey of issues, malware penetration, and defenses (2015) IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 17 (2), pp. 998-1022; Huang, L., Joseph, A.D., Nelson, B., Rubinstein, B.I., Tygar, J., Adversarial machine learning (2011) Proceedings of the 4th ACM Workshop on Security and Artificial Intelligence, pp. 43-58. , ACM; Ikram, M., Vallina-Rodriguez, N., Seneviratne, S., Kaafar, M.A., Paxson, V., An analysis of the privacy and security risks of android vpn permission-enabled apps (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 ACM on Internet Measurement Conference, pp. 349-364. , ACM; Laskov, P., Practical evasion of a learning-based classifier: A case study (2014) Security and Privacy (SP), 2014 IEEE Symposium on, pp. 197-211. , IEEE; Lowd, D., Meek, C., Good word attacks on statistical spam filters (2005) CEAS; Mariconti, E., Onwuzurike, L., Andriotis, P., De Cristofaro, E., Ross, G., Stringhini, G., Mamadroid: Detecting android malware by building markov chains of behavioral models (2017) NDSS; Nelson, B., Barreno, M., Chi, F.J., Joseph, A.D., Rubinstein, B.I., Saini, U., Sutton, C., Xia, K., Misleading learners: Co-opting your spam filter (2009) Machine Learning in Cyber Trust, pp. 17-51. , Springer; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Goodfellow, I., Jha, S., Celik, Z.B., Swami, A., Practical black-box attacks against machine learning (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 506-519. , ACM; Rubinstein, B.I., Nelson, B., Huang, L., Joseph, A.D., Lau, S.-H., Rao, S., Taft, N., Tygar, J., Antidote: Understanding and defending against poisoning of anomaly detectors (2009) Proceedings of the 9th ACM SIGCOMM Conference on Internet Measurement Conference, pp. 1-14. , ACM; Russu, P., Demontis, A., Biggio, B., Fumera, G., Roli, F., Secure kernel machines against evasion attacks (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 ACM Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Security, pp. 59-69. , ACM; Smutz, C., Stavrou, A., Malicious pdf detection using metadata and structural features (2012) Proceedings of the 28th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference, pp. 239-248. , ACM; Tan, K.M., Killourhy, K.S., Maxion, R.A., Undermining an anomaly-based intrusion detection system using common exploits (2002) International Workshop on Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection, pp. 54-73. , Springer; Woods, K., Kegelmeyer, W.P., Bowyer, K., Combination of multiple classifiers using local accuracy estimates (1997) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 19 (4), pp. 405-410; Xiao, H., Biggio, B., Brown, G., Fumera, G., Eckert, C., Roli, F., Is feature selection secure against training data poisoning?

As the preliminary step, the adversary starts with an exploratory attack based on deep learning (DL) and builds a functionally equivalent classifier by polling the online target classifier with input data and observing the returned labels. Using this inferred classifier, the adversary can select samples according to their DL scores and feed them to the original classifier. In an evasion attack, the adversary feeds the target classifier with test data after selecting samples with DL scores that are close to the decision boundary to increase the chance that these samples are misclassified. In a causative attack, the adversary feeds the target classifier with training data after changing the labels of samples with DL scores that are far away from the decision boundary to reduce the reliability of the training process. Results obtained for text and image classification show that the proposed evasion and causative attacks can significantly increase the error during test and training phases, respectively. A defense strategy is presented to change a small number of labels of the original classifier to prevent its reliable inference by the adversary and its effective use in evasion and causative attacks. These findings identify new vulnerabilities of machine learning and demonstrate that a proactive defense mechanism can reduce the impact of the underlying attacks. © 2017 IEEE.",attack mitigation; causative attack; cybersecurity; deep learning; evasion attack; exploratory attack; image classification; Machine learning; text classification,Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Image classification; Learning systems; Military communications; Network security; Text processing; Attack mitigations; causative attack; Cyber security; evasion attack; exploratory attack; Text classification; Classification (of information),,,,,"Huang, L., Joseph, A., Nelson, B., Rubinstein, B., Tygar, J., Adversarial machine learning (2011) Proc.

The attack surface of these remotely located, sensing and communicating devices is both large, and exposed to adversarial actors, making mission assurance a challenging problem. While best-practice security policies should be followed, they are rarely enough to guarantee mission success as not all components in the system may be trusted and the properties of the environment (e.g., the RF environment) may be under the control of the attacker. CPS must thus be built with a high degree of resilience to mitigate threats that security cannot alleviate. In this paper, we describe the Agile and Resilient Embedded Systems (ARES) methodology and metric set. The ARES methodology pursues cyber security and resilience (CSR) as high level system properties to be developed in the context of the mission. An analytic process guides system developers in defining mission objectives, examining principal issues, applying CSR technologies, and understanding their interactions. © 2017 IEEE.",assessment; cyber resilience; cyber security; design for cyber security; metrics; mission assurance; systems analysis,Antennas; Military communications; Systems analysis; assessment; cyber resilience; Cyber security; metrics; Mission assurances; Embedded systems,,,,,"(2017), https://www.dhs.gov/what-security-and-resilience, accessed March 23; Bodeau, D., Graubart, R., (2011) Cyber Resiliency Engineering Framework, , https://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/pdf/11_4436.pdf, MITRE, September, accessed April 1, 2017; Bodeau, D., Graubart, R., LaPadula, L., Kertzner, P., Rosenthal, A., Brennan, J., (2012) Cyber Resiliency Metrics, Version 1. 0, , https://register.mitre.org/sr/12_2226.pdf, Rev. 1, MITRE, April, accessed April 1, 2017; Takai, T.M., (2014) Department of Defense Instruction, Subject: Cybersecurity, , http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/850001_2014.pdf, 14 Mar, assessed April 1, 2017; (2013) Task Force Report: Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat, , http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA569975, DoD Defense Science Board, January accessed April 1, 2017; Delaney, W.P., (2015) Perspectives on Defense Systems Analysis, , MIT Lincoln Laboratory Series, MIT Press; Leveson, N., (2011) Engineering A Safer World: Systems Thinking Applied to Safety, , MIT Press; Vai, M., Whelihan, D., (2016) Systems Design of Cybersecurity in Embedded Systems, 2016 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC 16), , September; (2017), https://3dr.com/support/articles/207681813/x8-m/, accessed April 1; (2017), https://pixhawk.org/modules/pixhawk, assessed April 1; (2017), https://sel4.systems/, assessed April 1; Vai, M., Nahill, B., Kramer, J., Geis, M., Utin, D., Whelihan, D., Khazan, R., Secure architecture for embedded systems (2015) 2015 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC 15), , September",,,AFCEA;IEEE;IEEE Communications Society,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference, MILCOM 2017",23 October 2017 through 25 October 2017,,133664,,9.78154E+12,PMICE,,English,Proc IEEE Mil Commun Conf MILCOM,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042358535

A small distortion on a sample leads to misclassification easily. Until now, the vulnerability issue of stacked autoencoder, which is one of the most popular deep learning algorithms, has not been investigated. In this paper, we firstly investigate the existing evasion attack to stacked autoencoder in an effort to understand whether, and to what extent, they can work efficiently. A robust learning algorithm which minimizes both its error and sensitivity is then proposed for stacked autoencoder. The sensitivity is defined as the change of the output due to a small fluctuation on the input. As the proposed algorithm considers not only accuracy but also stability, a more robust stacked autoencoder against evasion attack is expected. The performance of our methods is then evaluated and compared with conventional stacked autoencoder and denoising autoencoder experimentally in terms of accuracy, robustness and time complexity. Moreover, the experimental results also suggest that the proposed learning method is more robust than others when a training set is contaminated. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Adversarial learning; Deep learning; Evasion attack; Robustness; Sensitivity,Deep learning; Robustness (control systems); Adversarial environments; Adversarial learning; Denoising Autoencoder; Evasion attack; Misclassifications; Robust learning algorithm; Sensitivity; Stacked autoencoder; Learning algorithms; Article; autoencoder; classifier; computer security; data processing; learning algorithm; machine learning; priority journal,,,,,"Liu, W., Wang, Z., Liu, X., Zeng, N., Liu, Y., Alsaadi, F.E., A survey of deep neural network architectures and their applications (2016) Neurocomputing, 234, pp. 11-26; Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G.E., Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (2012) Proceedings of the International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 1097-1105; Szegedy, C., Liu, W., Jia, Y., Sermanet, P., Reed, S., Anguelov, D., Erhan, D., Rabinovich, A., Going deeper with convolutions (2014) Proceedings of the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 1-9; Tompson, J.J., Jain, A., LeCun, Y., Bregler, C., Joint training of a convolutional network and a graphical model for human pose estimation (2014) Advances in neural information processing systems, pp. 1799-1807; Zeng, N., Wang, Z., Zhang, H., Liu, W., Alsaadi, F.E., Deep belief networks for quantitative analysis of a gold immunochromatographic strip (2016) Cogn.

With limitations on time and skilled resources, organizations often look at ways to identify threatened vulnerabilities for patch prioritization. In this paper, we present an exploit prediction model that predicts whether a vulnerability will be exploited. Our proposed model leverages data from a variety of online data sources (white-hat community, vulnerability researchers community, and darkweb/deepweb sites) with vulnerability mentions. Compared to the standard scoring system (CVSS base score), our model outperforms the baseline models with an F1 measure of 0.40 on the minority class (266% improvement over CVSS base score) and also achieves high True Positive Rate at low False Positive Rate (90%, 13%, respectively). The results demonstrate that the model is highly effective as an early predictor of exploits that could appear in the wild. We also present a qualitative and quantitative study regarding the increase in the likelihood of exploitation incurred when a vulnerability is mentioned in each of the data sources we examine. © 2017 IEEE.",adversarial machine learning; darkweb analysis; online vulnerability mentions; vulnerability exploit prediction,darkweb analysis; False positive rates; Online data sources; online vulnerability mentions; Quantitative study; Real-world attack; Software vulnerabilities; True positive rates; Learning systems,,,,,"Edkrantz, M., Said, A., Predicting cyber vulnerability exploits with machine learning (2015) SCAI, pp. 48-57; Allodi, L., Massacci, F., Comparing vulnerability severity and exploits using case-control studies (2014) ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC), 17 (1), p. 1; Nayak, K., Marino, D., Efstathopoulos, P., Dumitras, T., Some vulnerabilities are different than others (2014) International Workshop on Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection, pp. 426-446. , Springer; Sabottke, C., Suciu, O., Dumitras, T., Vulnerability disclosure in the age of social media: Exploiting twitter for predicting real-world exploits (2015) USENIX Security, 15; (2015) 2015 Data Breach Investigations Report; Bullough, B.L., Yanchenko, A.K., Smith, C.L., Zipkin, J.R., Predicting exploitation of disclosed software vulnerabilities using opensource data (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Workshop on Security and Privacy Analytics.

However, most (if not all) of these techniques suffer from a common limitation: feasibility of these attacks is unknown. The synthesized mutations may break the inherent constraints posed by code structures of the malware, causing either crashes or malfunctioning of malicious payloads. To address the limitation, we present Malware Recomposition Variation (MRV), an approach that conducts semantic analysis of existing malware to systematically construct new malware variants for malware detectors to test and strengthen their detection signatures/models. In particular, we use two variation strategies (i.e., malware evolution attack and malware confusion attack) following structures of existing malware to enhance feasibility of the attacks. Upon the given malware, we conduct semantic-feature mutation analysis and phylogenetic analysis to synthesize mutation strategies. Based on these strategies, we perform program transplantation to automatically mutate malware bytecode to generate new malware variants. We evaluate our MRV approach on actual malware variants, and our empirical evaluation on 1,935 Android benign apps and 1,917 malware shows that MRV produces malware variants that can have high likelihood to evade detection while still retaining their malicious behaviors. We also propose and evaluate three defense mechanisms to counter MRV. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Of particular concern is use of ML in cyberphysical systems, such as driverless cars and aviation, where the presence of an adversary can cause serious consequences. In this paper we focus on attacks caused by adversarial samples, which are inputs crafted by adding small, often imperceptible, perturbations to force a ML model to misclassify. We present a simple gradient-descent based algorithm for finding adversarial samples, which performs well in comparison to existing algorithms. The second issue that this paper tackles is that of metrics. We present a novel metric based on few computer-vision algorithms for measuring the quality of adversarial samples.",Adversarial Examples; Machine Learning,Artificial intelligence; Embedded systems; Learning systems; Malware; Medical computing; Security of data; Security systems; Speech recognition; Adversarial Examples; Automotive Systems; Computer vision algorithms; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Gradient descent; Gradient descent algorithms; Malware detection; Objective metrics; Computer vision,,,,,"Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), , DeepFace: Closing the Gap to Human-Level Performance in Face Verification; Alipanahi, B., Delong, A., Weirauch, M.T., Frey, B.J., Predicting the sequence specificities of DNA-And RNA-binding proteins by deep learning (2015) Nature Biotechnology, 2015; Bojarski, M., Del Testa, D., Dworakowski, D., Firner, B., Flepp, B., Goyal, P., Jackel, L., Zieba, K., (2016) End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars, , Technical Report; Bojarski, M., Del Testa, D., Dworakowski, D., Firner, B., Flepp, B., Goyal, P., Jackel, L.D., Zieba, K., (2016) End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07316, CoRR abs/1604.07316 2016; Canny, J., A computational approach to edge detection (1986) IEEE Trans.

To protect legitimate users from the evolving Android malware attacks, machine learning-based systems have been successfully deployed and offer unparalleled flexibility in automatic Android malware detection. In these systems, based on different feature representations, various kinds of classifiers are constructed to detect Android malware. Unfortunately, as classifiers become more widely deployed, the incentive for defeating them increases. In this paper, we explore the security of machine learning in Android malware detection on the basis of a learning-based classifier with the input of a set of features extracted from the Android applications (apps). We consider different importances of the features associated with their contributions to the classification problem as well as their manipulation costs, and present a novel feature selection method (named SecCLS) to make the classifier harder to be evaded. To improve the system security while not compromising the detection accuracy, we further propose an ensemble learning approach (named SecENS) by aggregating the individual classifiers that are constructed using our proposed feature selection method SecCLS. Accordingly, we develop a system called SecureDroid which integrates our proposed methods (i.e., SecCLS and SecENS) to enhance security of machine learningbased Android malware detection. Comprehensive experiments on the real sample collections from Comodo Cloud Security Center are conducted to validate the effectiveness of SecureDroid against adversarial Android malware attacks by comparisons with other alternative defense methods. Our proposed secure-learning paradigm can also be readily applied to other malware detection tasks. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

However, recent studies demonstrated that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial manipulations at testing time. Specifically, suppose we have a testing example, whose label can be correctly predicted by a DNN classifier. An attacker can add a small carefully crafted noise to the testing example such that the DNN classifier predicts an incorrect label, where the crafted testing example is called adversarial example. Such attacks are called evasion attacks. Evasion attacks are one of the biggest challenges for deploying DNNs in safety and security critical applications such as self-driving cars. In this work, we develop new DNNs that are robust to stateof-the-Art evasion attacks. Our key observation is that adversarial examples are close to the classification boundary. Therefore, we propose region-based classification to be robust to adversarial examples. Specifically, for a benign/adversarial testing example, we ensemble information in a hypercube centered at the example to predict its label. In contrast, traditional classifiers are point-based classification, i.e., given a testing example, the classifier predicts its label based on the testing example alone. Our evaluation results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that our region-based classification can significantly mitigate evasion attacks without sacrificing classification accuracy on benign examples. Specifically, our region-based classification achieves the same classification accuracy on testing benign examples as point-based classification, but our region-based classification is significantly more robust than point-based classification to state-of-The-Art evasion attacks.",Adversarial machine learning; Evasion attacks; Region-based classification,Artificial intelligence; Deep neural networks; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Security of data; Security systems; Speech recognition; Artificial intelligence research; Classification accuracy; Classification boundary; Evaluation results; Evasion attacks; Region-based; Safety and securities; State of the art; Classification (of information),,,,,"Biggio, B., Nelson, B., Laskov, P., Poisoning attacks against support vector machines (2012) ICML; Carlini, N., Wagner, D., Towards evaluating the robustness of neural networks (2017) IEEE S & P; Goodfellow, I.J., Shlens, J., Szegedy, C., (2014) Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples, , arXiv; Grosse, K., Manoharan, P., Papernot, N., Backes, M., McDaniel, P., (2017) On the (Statistical) Detection of Adversarial Examples, , arXiv; He, K., Zhang, X., Ren, S., Sun, J., Deep residual learning for image recognition (2016) CVPR; Hinton, G., Deng, L., Yu, D., Dahl, G.E., Mohamed, A., Jaitly, N., Senior, A., Sainath, T.N., Deep neural networks for acoustic modeling in speech recognition: The shared views of four research groups (2012) IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 29 (6), pp. 82-97. , 2012; Huang, L., Joseph, A.D., Nelson, B., Rubinstein, B.I., Tygar, J.D., (2011) Adversarial Machine Learning, , ACM AISec; Kingma, D.P., Ba, J., (2014) Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization, , arXiv; Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G.E., Imagenet classification with deep convolutional Neural Networks (2012) NIPS; Li, B., Wang, Y., Singh, A., Vorobeychik, Y., Data poisoning attacks on factorization-based Collaborative Filtering (2016) NIPS; Liu, Y., Chen, X., Liu, C., Song, D., Delving into transferable adversarial examples and Black-box Attacks (2017) ICLR; Meng, D., Chen, H., Magnet: A two-pronged defense against adversarial Examples (2017) CCS; Hendrik Metzen, J., Genewein, T., Fischer, V., Bischof, B., On detecting adversarial perturbations (2017) ICLR; Mikolov, T., Chen, K., Corrado, G., Dean, J., (2013) Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space, , arXiv 2013; Moosavi-Dezfooli, S., Fawzi, A., Frossard, P., Deepfool: A simple and accurate method to fool deep neural networks (2016) CVPR; Nelson, B., Barreno, M., Chi, F.J., Joseph, A.D., Rubinstein, B.I.P., Saini, U., Sutton, C., Xia, K., Exploiting machine learning to subvert your spam filter (2008) LEET; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Goodfellow, I., Jha, S., Berkay Celik, Z., Swami, A., Practical black-box attacks against machine learning (2017) AsiaCCS; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Jha, S., Fredrikson, M., Berkay Celik, Z., Swami, A., The limitations of deep learning in adversarial Settings (2016) EuroS&P; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Wu, X., Jha, S., Swami, A., Distillation as a defense to adversarial perturbations against Deep Neural Networks (2016) IEEE S & P; Shen, S., Tople, S., Saxena, P., Auror: Defending against poisoning attacks in Collaborative Deep Learning Systems (2016) ACSAC; Silver, D., Huang, A., Maddison, C.J., Guez, A., Sifre, L., Van Den Driessche, G., Schrittwieser, J., Lanctot, M., Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search (2016) Nature, 529 (7587), pp. 484-489. , 2016; Szegedy, C., Zaremba, W., Sutskever, I., Bruna, J., Erhan, D., Goodfellow, I., Fergus, R., (2013) Intriguing Properties of Neural Networks, , arXiv; (2017) Code to Train DNN for CIFAR-10, , https://goo.gl/mEX7By, September 2017; Yang, G., Zhenqiang Gong, N., Cai, Y., Fake co-visitation injection attacks to recommender systems (2017) NDSS",,,Applied Computer Security Associates (ACSA),Association for Computing Machinery,"33rd Annual Computer Security Applications Conference, ACSAC 2017",4 December 2017 through 8 December 2017,,132521,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ACM Int.

The authors' system detects human faces and silhouettes in the input video and replaces the detected faces with random synthesised faces obtained using a deep convolutional generative adversarial network. Alternative hairstyles are rendered over the synthesised faces, and the human silhouette is recoloured so that skin hues are preserved and clothing hues are altered. Through the use of artificially synthesised faces that look realistic, they ensure that the de-identified image looks natural and at the same time avoid ethical and legal considerations present when using real face images as replacement faces. As they address non-biometric feature de-identification, their system offers a considerably higher level of privacy protection than commonly employed solutions that use simple image processing techniques such as blurring. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation suggests that their system produces de-identified images that look natural, at the same time being resistant to re-identification attacks. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.",,Biometrics; Video recording; Adversarial networks; Biometric features; De-identification; Human silhouette; Privacy protection; Quantitative evaluation; Re identifications; Simple image processing techniques; Image processing,,,,,"Newton, E.M., Sweeney, L., Malin, B., Preserving privacy by de-identifying face images (2005) IEEE TKDE, 17 (2), pp. 232-243; Ribaric, S., Ariyaeeinia, A., Pavešic, N., De-identification for privacy protection in multimedia content: a survey (2016) Signal Process., Image Commun., 47, pp. 131-151; Gross, R., Sweeney, L., Cohn, J.F., Face de-identification (2009) Protecting privacy in video surveillance, pp. 129-146. , in Senior, A.

On the one hand, context-free privacy solutions, such as differential privacy, provide strong privacy guarantees, but often lead to a significant reduction in utility. On the other hand, context-aware privacy solutions, such as information theoretic privacy, achieve an improved privacy-utility tradeoff, but assume that the data holder has access to dataset statistics. We circumvent these limitations by introducing a novel context-aware privacy framework called generative adversarial privacy (GAP). GAP leverages recent advancements in generative adversarial networks (GANs) to allow the data holder to learn privatization schemes from the dataset itself. Under GAP, learning the privacy mechanism is formulated as a constrained minimax game between two players: a privatizer that sanitizes the dataset in a way that limits the risk of inference attacks on the individuals' private variables, and an adversary that tries to infer the private variables from the sanitized dataset. To evaluate GAP's performance, we investigate two simple (yet canonical) statistical dataset models: (a) the binary data model; and (b) the binary Gaussian mixture model. For both models, we derive game-theoretically optimal minimax privacy mechanisms, and show that the privacy mechanisms learned from data (in a generative adversarial fashion) match the theoretically optimal ones. This demonstrates that our framework can be easily applied in practice, even in the absence of dataset statistics. © 2017 by the authors.",Adversarial network; Differential privacy; Error probability games; Generative adversarial networks; Generative adversarial privacy; Information theoretic privacy; Machine learning; Mutual information privacy; Privatizer network; Statistical data privacy,,,,,,"Economist, T., (2017) The World's Most Valuable Resource Is No Longer Oil, but Data, , The Economist: New York, NY, USA; (2016) National Privacy Research Strategy, , Technical Report; Executive Office of the President of the United States: Washington, DC, USA; The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), , http://www.eugdpr.org/, (accessed on 22 November 2017); Samarati, P., Sweeney, L., (1998) Protecting Privacy When Disclosing Information: k-Anonymity and Its Enforcement through Generalization and Suppression, , Technical Report; SRI International: Menlo Park, CA, USA; Sweeney, L., k-Anonymity: A model for protecting privacy (2002) Int.

Quantum dialogue (QD) falls under QSDC where the secrete messages are communicated simultaneously between two legitimate parties. The successful experimental demonstration of QSDC opens up the possibilities for practical implementation of QD protocols. Thus, it is necessary to analyze the practical security issues of QD protocols for future implementation. Since the very first proposal for QD by Nguyen (Phys Lett A 328:6–10, 2004), a large number of variants and extensions have been presented till date. However, all of those leak half of the secret bits to the adversary through classical communications of the measurement results. In this direction, motivated by the idea of Lo et al. (Phys Rev Lett 108:130503, 2012), we propose a measurement device-independent quantum dialogue scheme which is resistant to such information leakage as well as side-channel attacks. In the proposed protocol, Alice and Bob, two legitimate parties, are allowed to prepare the states only. The states are measured by an untrusted third party who may himself behave as an adversary. We show that our protocol is secure under this adversarial model. The current protocol does not require any quantum memory, and thus, it is inherently robust against memory attacks. Such robustness might not be guaranteed in the QSDC protocol with quantum memory (Zhang et al. 2017). © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Measurement device independence; Quantum secure direct communication; Security analysis; Symmetric cipher,Aluminum; Quantum communication; Quantum theory; Side channel attack; Atomic quantum memory; Classical communication; Experimental demonstrations; Information leakage; Measurement device; Quantum secure direct communication; Security analysis; Symmetric cipher; Quantum cryptography,,,,,"Shor, P.W., Algorithms for quantum computation: Discrete Logarithms and Factoring (1994) Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) 1994, pp. 124–134, IEEE Computer Society Press; Bennett, C., Wiesner, S., Communication via one and two-particle operators on Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen states (1992) Phys.

Under event-triggered scheme, the original plant is augmented into a discrete-time system, where the states and attacks are assembled into the state vector of the new system. Then, based on the augmented system, a discrete-time secure observer is presented to estimate the states and attacks. Besides, a novel secure observer-based controller, where the actuator attack estimations are utilized to neutralize the actuator attacks, is proposed. A cone complementarity linearization (CCL) algorithm is provided to co-design the desired observer and controller. It is shown that using the proposed secure observer-based controller, the states of the original plant converge to a small neighborhood of the origin despite attacks. Finally, an illustrative example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Actuator and sensor attacks; Cyber-physical systems; Event-triggered scheme; Secure observer-based controller,Actuators; Continuous time systems; Control system analysis; Cyber Physical System; Digital control systems; Discrete time control systems; Embedded systems; Augmented systems; Cone complementarity linearization; Continuous-time; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Discrete - time systems; Event-triggered; Observer based control; Observer-based controllers; Controllers,,,,,"Ding, D., Wang, Z., Han, Q.L., Wei, G., Security control for discrete-time stochastic nonlinear systems subject to deception attacks (2016) IEEE Trans.

The traditional key exchange protocols involve a trusted key generation center for generation and distribution of the group key among the various group members. Therefore, the establishment of a trusted key generation center server and the generation (and distribution) of common session key require an extra overhead. To avoid this difficulty, a number of group key exchange protocols have been proposed in the literature. However, these protocols are vulnerable to many attacks and have a high computational and communication cost. In this paper, we present an elliptic curve cryptography–based authenticated group key exchange (ECC-AGKE) protocol, which provides better security and has lower computational cost compared to related proposed schemes. Further, a complexity reduction method is deployed to reduce the overall complexity of the proposed elliptic curve cryptography–based authenticated group key exchange protocol. The security of proposed work is ensured by the properties of elliptic curves. A security adversarial model is given and an extensive formal security analysis against our claim is done in the random oracle model. We also made a comparison of our proposed protocol with similar works and found that ours have better complexity, security and efficiency over others.

Advanced network scanning techniques are often used for this purpose and are automatically executed by malware infected hosts. In this paper, we formally define network deception to defend reconnaissance and develop a reconnaissance deception system, which is based on software defined networking, to achieve deception by simulating virtual topologies. Our system thwarts network reconnaissance by delaying the scanning techniques of adversaries and invalidating their collected information, while limiting the performance impact on benign network traffic. By simulating the topological as well as physical characteristics of networks, we introduce a system which deceives malicious network discovery and reconnaissance techniques with virtual information, while limiting the information an attacker is able to harvest from the true underlying system. This approach shows a novel defense technique against adversarial reconnaissance missions which are required for targeted cyber attacks such as advanced persistent threats in highly connected environments. The defense steps of our system aim to invalidate an attackers information, delay the process of finding vulnerable hosts and identify the source of adversarial reconnaissance within a network. © 2017 IEEE.",Security management; Security services; Software-defined networks,Crime; Malware; Network architecture; Network security; Servers; Software defined networking; Topology; Delays; Limiting; Network topology; Reconnaissance; Security management; Security services; Computer crime,,,,,"Advanced Persistent Threats-Attack and Defense, , http://bit.ly/2jrUIyI, Accessed on Feb. 20, 2017.

Developments concerning the IoT and CPS will improve critical infrastructure, vehicle networks, and personal health products. Unfortunately, these systems are vulnerable to attack. Advanced persistent threats (APTs) are a class of long-term attacks in which well-resourced adversaries infiltrate a network and use obfuscation to remain undetected. In a CPS under APTs, each device must decide whether to trust other components that may be compromised. In this paper, we propose a concept of trust (strategic trust) that uses game theory to capture the adversarial and strategic nature of CPS security. Specifically, we model an interaction between the administrator of a cloud service, an attacker, and a device that decides whether to trust signals from the vulnerable cloud. Our framework consists of a simultaneous signaling game and the FlipIt game. The equilibrium outcome in the signaling game determines the incentives in the FlipIt game. In turn, the equilibrium outcome in the FlipIt game determines the prior probabilities in the signaling game. The Gestalt Nash equilibrium (GNE) characterizes the steady state of the overall macro-game. The novel contributions of this paper include proofs of the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the GNE. We also apply GNEs to strategically design a trust mechanism for a cloud-assisted insulin pump. Without requiring the use of historical data, the GNE obtains a risk threshold beyond which the pump should not trust messages from the cloud. Our framework contributes to a modeling paradigm called games-of-games. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",cyber-physical systems; cyber-security; Internet of things; perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium; signaling game; trust,Computation theory; Embedded systems; Game theory; Internet of things; Signaling; Trusted computing; Bayesian Nash equilibria; Cyber security; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Internet of thing (IOT); Modeling paradigms; Prior probability; Signaling game; trust; Cyber Physical System,,,,,"Swan, M., Sensor mania! the Internet of Things, wearable computing, objective metrics, and the quantified self 2. 0 (2012) J Sens.

However, standard classification tools often perform poorly, because an adaptive attacker can shape his attacks in response to the algorithm. This has led to the recent interest in developing methods for adversarial classification, but to the best of our knowledge, there have been a very few prior studies that take into account the attacker's tradeoff between adapting to the classifier being used against him with his desire to maintain the efficacy of his attack. Including this effect is a key to derive solutions that perform well in practice. In this investigation, we model the interaction as a game between a defender who chooses a classifier to distinguish between attacks and normal behavior based on a set of observed features and an attacker who chooses his attack features (class 1 data). Normal behavior (class 0 data) is random and exogenous. The attacker's objective balances the benefit from attacks and the cost of being detected while the defender's objective balances the benefit of a correct attack detection and the cost of false alarm. We provide an efficient algorithm to compute all Nash equilibria and a compact characterization of the possible forms of a Nash equilibrium that reveals intuitive messages on how to perform classification in the presence of an attacker. We also explore qualitatively and quantitatively the impact of the non-attacker and underlying parameters on the equilibrium strategies. © 2017 IEEE.",Adversarial classification; game theory; Nash equilibrium; randomization; security; threshold strategies,Computation theory; Adversarial classifications; Nash equilibria; randomization; security; Threshold strategy; Game theory,,,,,"Alpcan, T., Basar, T., A game theoretic approach to decision and analysis in network intrusion detection (2003) Proc.

To improve the robustness of any networked system, it is important to analyze vulnerability to external perturbation such as random failures or adversarial attacks occurring to elements of the network. In this paper, we study an emerging problem in assessing the robustness of complex networks: the vulnerability of the clustering of the network to the failure of network elements. Specifically, we identify vertices whose failures will critically damage the network by degrading its clustering, evaluated through the average clustering coefficient. This problem is important because any significant change made to the clustering, resulting from element-wise failures, could degrade network performance such as the ability for information to propagate in a social network. We formulate this vulnerability analysis as an optimization problem, prove its NP-completeness and non-monotonicity, and offer two algorithms to identify the vertices most important to clustering. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments in synthesized social networks generated by various well-known models as well as traces of real social networks. The empirical results over other competitive strategies show the efficacy of our proposed algorithms. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Wien.",Local clustering coefficient; Network reliability; Network science,Large scale systems; Network security; Optimization; Clustering coefficient; Competitive strategy; External perturbations; Local clustering; Network reliability; Network science; Optimization problems; Vulnerability analysis; Complex networks,,,,,"Albert, R., Jeong, H., Barabási, A.L., Error and attack tolerance of complex networks (2000) Nature, 406, p. 200; Albert, R., Barabási, A.-L., Statistical mechanics of complex networks (2002) Rev Mod Phys, 74, pp. 47-97; Alim, M.A., Kunhle, A., (2014) Thai MT, , Are communities as strong as we think?

However, in many practical situations these are unrealistic assumptions: The seed is often gathered after a reset/reboot from low entropy external events such as the timing of manual key presses, and the state can be compromised at unknown points in time via side channels or penetration attacks. The usual remedy (used by all the major operating systems, including Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, MacOS, iOS, etc.) is to periodically replenish the internal state through an auxiliary input with additional randomness harvested from the environment. However, recovering from such attacks in a provably correct and computationally optimal way had remained an unsolved challenge so far. In this paper we formalize the problem of designing an efficient recovery mechanism from state compromise, by considering it as an online optimization problem. If we knew the timing of the last compromise and the amount of entropy gathered since then, we could stop producing any outputs until the state becomes truly random again. However, our challenge is to recover within a time proportional to this optimal solution even in the hardest (and most realistic) case in which (a) we know nothing about the timing of the last state compromise, and the amount of new entropy injected since then into the state, and (b) any premature production of outputs leads to the total loss of all the added entropy used by the RNG, since the attacker can use brute force to enumerate all the possible low-entropy states. In other words, the challenge is to develop recovery mechanisms which are guaranteed to save the day as quickly as possible after a compromise we are not even aware of. The dilemma that we face is that any entropy used prematurely will be lost, and any entropy which is kept unused will delay the recovery. After developing our formal definitional framework for RNGs with inputs, we show how to construct a nearly optimal RNG which is secure in our model. Our technique is inspired by the design of the Fortuna RNG (which is a heuristic RNG construction that is currently used by Windows and comes without any formal analysis), but we non-trivially adapt it to our much stronger adversarial setting. Along the way, our formal treatment of Fortuna enables us to improve its entropy efficiency by almost a factor of two, and to show that our improved construction is essentially tight, by proving a rigorous lower bound on the possible efficiency of any recovery mechanism in our very general model of the problem. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Random number generator; RNG; State compromise,Computer operating systems; Efficiency; Number theory; Optimization; Random number generation; Recovery; Side channel attack; Auxiliary inputs; Cryptographic schemes; Online optimization; Optimal recovery; Optimal solutions; Random number generators; Recovery mechanisms; State compromise; Entropy,,,,,"Barak, B., Halevi, S., A model and architecture for pseudo-random generation with applications to /dev/random (2005) Proceedings of the 12th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, CCS ’05, ACM, pp. 203-212. , New York, NY: USA; Barker, E., Kelsey, J., (2012) Recommendation for Random Number Generation Using Deterministic Random Bit Generators, , NIST Special Publication, Oakland; Bellare, M., Rogaway, P., The security of triple encryption and a framework for code-based game-playing proofs (2006) Advances in Cryptology—EUROCRYPT.

Unlike the existing results, this study investigates the attack-resilient state estimation problem for continuous-time linear systems with sparse actuator attacks and process noises. It is assumed that, the attacker has limited resources and can only manipulate a certain number of actuators. Specifically, a novel switched observer is proposed with milder design conditions which are derived in terms of linear matrix (in)equalities. It is shown that, the observer not only provides an attack-resilient state estimation, but also guarantees that the resulting observer error system is with noise attenuation level which can be optimised. Finally, a simulation example of a linearised reduced-order aircraft system is provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.",,Actuators; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Linear systems; State estimation; Aircraft systems; Continuous-time linear systems; Design condition; Estimation problem; Noise attenuation; Number of actuators; Observer errors; Simulation example; Continuous time systems,,,,,"Pasqualetti, F., Dorfler, F., Bullo, F., Control-theoretic methods for cyberphysical security: Geometric principles for optimal cross-layer resilient control systems (2015) IEEE Control Syst, 35 (1), pp. 110-127; Cárdenas, A.A., Amin, S., Sastry, S., Research challenges for the security of control systems (2008) Proc. of the 3rd Conf.

Anomaly detectors usually come at greater cost in resources over signature detectors spurring the desire to translate anomalies into identifiable signatures. Automatic Signature Generation (ASG) attempts to automate the process of creating signatures to describe newly identified malicious network traffic. However, the quality of the signatures created in ASG depends on the ability to identify malicious traffic which remains a difficult problem plagued by massive amounts of data, high-speed links, and an adversarial environment. As a result, the detection process itself can greatly hamper the process of Automatic Signature Generation.This research attempts to leverage the Metasploit framework to provide a simulation environment that can execute exploits and record those attacks without interference from rogue users or any reliance on detection methods. This simulation environment side-steps the problem of identifying the malicious traffic because the executed exploits are known malicious and isolated. The Metasploit framework provides many tools for mutating and varying attack signatures such that each execution of an exploit may have a wildly different signature. We employ this mutational feature of Metasploit, and use prior ASG techniques, to create a smaller set of signatures that address the core of an attack rather than quantifying each variant. We demonstrate that creating signatures in such an environment is not only viable, but may even be desirablein order for a user to have the most effective signature set for their purpose. © 2017 IEEE.",Automatic Signature Generation; Exploit Simulation; Intrusion Detection; Network Security,Computer networks; Intrusion detection; Security of data; Security systems; Adversarial environments; Anomaly detector; Automatic signature generations; Detection methods; Detection process; Exploit Simulation; Malicious traffic; Simulation environment; Network security,,,,,"Kim, H.-A., Karp, B., Autograph: Toward automated, distributed worm signature detection (2004) Proceedings of 13th USENIX Security Symposium; Newsome, J., Karp, B., Song, D., Polygraph: Automatically generating signatures for polymorphic worms (2005) Proceedings of IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, , May; Li, Z., Sanghi, M., Chen, Y., Kao, M., Chavez, B., Hamsa: Fast signature generation for zero-day polymorphic worms with provable attack resilience (2006) Proceedings of IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, , May; Singh, S., Estan, C., Varghese, G., Savage, S., Automated worm fingerprinting (2004) Proceedings of the 5th Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation; Cavallaro, L., Lanzi, A., Mayer, L., Monga, M., Lisabeth: Automated content-based signature generator for zero-day polymorphic worms (2008) Proceedings of the Fourth International Workshop on Software Engineering for Secure Systems; Chung, S.P., Mok, A.K., (2006) Allergy Attack Against Automatic Signature Generation, pp. 61-80. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg; Osorio, F., Qiu, H., Arott, A., Segmented sandboxing-A novel approach to malware polymorphism detection (2015) Malicious and Unwanted Software (MALWARE), 2015 10th International Conference on; http://www.snort.org/, Snort User Manual 2.9.9, The Snort Project, Jan. 2017; Paxson, V., Bro: A system for detecting network intruders in real-time (1999) Computer Networks, 31 (23-24), pp. 2435-2463. , Dec; Tylman, W., Data mining techniques for semi-automatic signature generation (2009) Dependability of Computer Systems, International Conference on, pp. 210-217; Garcia-Teodoro, P., Diaz-Verdejo, J., Tapiador, J., Salazar-Hernandez, R., Automatic generation of http intrusion signatures by selective identification of anomalies (2015) Comput.

Existing approaches such as average degree maximization suffer from the bias of including more nodes than necessary, resulting in lower accuracy and increased need for manual verification. Hence, we propose HoloScope, which introduces a novel metric ""contrast suspiciousness"" integrating information from graph topology and spikes to more accurately detect fraudulent users and objects. Contrast suspiciousness dynamically emphasizes the contrast patterns between fraudsters and normal users, making HoloScope capable of distinguishing the synchronized and anomalous behaviors of fraudsters on topology, bursts and drops, and rating scores. In addition, we provide theoretical bounds for how much this increases the time cost needed for fraudsters to conduct adversarial attacks. Moreover, HoloScope has a concise framework and sub-quadratic time complexity, making the algorithm reproducible and scalable. Extensive experiments showed that HoloScope achieved significant accuracy improvements on synthetic and real data, compared with state-of-the-art fraud detection methods. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Burst and drop;

Adversarial samples are crafted with a deliberate intention of undermining a system. In the case of DNNs, the lack of better understanding of their working has prevented the development of efficient defenses. In this paper, we propose a new defense method based on practical observations which is easy to integrate into models and performs better than state-of-the-art defenses. Our proposed solution is meant to reinforce the structure of a DNN, making its prediction more stable and less likely to be fooled by adversarial samples. We conduct an extensive experimental study proving the efficiency of our method against multiple attacks, comparing it to numerous defenses, both in white-box and black-box setups. Additionally, the implementation of our method brings almost no overhead to the training procedure, while maintaining the prediction performance of the original model on clean samples. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Adversarial learning; Deep neural network; Defenses; Model security,Artificial intelligence; Deep neural networks; Adversarial learning; Black boxes; Defenses; Model security; Original model; Prediction performance; State of the art; Training procedures; Network security,,,,,"Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., Can machine learning be secure?

In high-dimensional settings, supervised learning commonly relies on dimensionality reduction to improve performance and identify the most important factors in predicting outcomes. However, the economic importance of learning has made it a natural target for adversarial manipulation of training data, which we term poisoning attacks. Prior approaches to dealing with robust supervised learning rely on strong assumptions about the nature of the feature matrix, such as feature independence and sub-Gaussian noise with low variance. We propose an integrated method for robust regression that relaxes these assumptions, assuming only that the feature matrix can be well approximated by a low-rank matrix. Our techniques integrate improved robust low-rank matrix approximation and robust principle component regression, and yield strong performance guarantees. Moreover, we experimentally show that our methods significantly outperform state-of-the-art robust regression both in running time and prediction error. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",,Artificial intelligence; Gaussian noise (electronic); Regression analysis; Supervised learning; Dimensionality reduction; Economic importance; Improve performance; Low-rank matrix approximations; Performance guarantees; Predicting outcomes; Principle component regression; Robust linear regression; Matrix algebra,,,,,"Alfeld, S., Zhu, X., Barford, P., Data poisoning attacks against autoregressive models (2016) AAAI; Androutsopoulos, I., Paliouras, G., Karkaletsis, V., Sakkis, G., Spyropoulos, C.D., Stamatopoulos, P., (2000) Learning to Filter Spam E-mail: A Comparison of a Naive Bayesian and a Memory-based Approach, , arXiv preprint cs/0009009 (2000); Barni, M., Tondi, B., Source distinguishability under corrupted training (2014) Information Forensics and Security (WIFS), 2014 IEEE International Workshop On, pp. 197-202. , IEEE; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Joseph, A.D., Doug Tygar, J., Can machine learning be secure?

Their predictions are used to make decisions about healthcare, security, investments and many other critical applications. Given this pervasiveness, it is not surprising that adversaries have an incentive to manipulate machine learning models to their advantage. One way of manipulating a model is through a poisoning or causative attack in which the adversary feeds carefully crafted poisonous data points into the training set. Taking advantage of recently developed tamper-free provenance frameworks, we present a methodology that uses contextual information about the origin and transformation of data points in the training set to identify poisonous data, thereby enabling online and regularly re-trained machine learning applications to consume data sources in potentially adversarial environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to incorporate provenance information as part of a filtering algorithm to detect causative attacks. We present two variations of the methodology-one tailored to partially trusted data sets and the other to fully untrusted data sets. Finally, we evaluate our methodology against existing methods to detect poison data and show an improvement in the detection rate. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Adversarial machine learning; Causative attacks; Internet of the Things; IoT; Poisoning attacks; Provenance; Security; Supervised learning,Artificial intelligence; Information filtering; Metadata; Supervised learning; Adversarial environments; Causative attacks; Contextual information; Machine learning applications; Machine learning models; Poisoning attacks; Provenance; Security; Learning systems,,,,,"Data provenance model for internet of things (IoT) systems (2017) Service-Oriented Computing - ICSOC 2016 Workshops, , Springer Berlin Heidelberg, Berlin, Heidelberg; Aman, M.N., Chua, K.C., Sikdar, B., Secure data provenance for the internet of things (2017) Proceedings of the 3rd ACM International Workshop on IoT Privacy, Trust, and Security (IoTPTS '17), pp. 11-14. , https://doi.org/10.1145/3055245.3055255, ACM, New York, NY, USA; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., The security of machine learning (2010) Machine Learning, 81 (2), pp. 121-148. , (2010); Biggio, B., Fumera, G., Roli, F., Security evaluation of pattern classifiers under attack (2014) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 26 (4), pp. 984-996. , (2014); Biggio, B., Nelson, B., Laskov, P., Support vector machines under adversarial label noise (2011) Asian Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 97-112; Biggio, B., Nelson, B., Laskov, P., (2012) Poisoning Attacks Against Support Vector Machines, , arXiv preprint (2012); Chakarov, A., Nori, A., Rajamani, S., Sen, S., Vijaykeerthy, D., (2016) Debugging Machine Learning Tasks, , arXiv preprint (2016); Gadelha, J., Kairos: An architecture for securing authorship and temporal information of provenance data in grid-enabled workfow management systems EScience'08; Gardiner, J., Nagaraja, S., On the security of machine learning in malware C8C detection: A survey (2016) ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 49 (3), p. 59. , (2016); Hasan, R., Sion, R., Winslett, M., The case of the fake Picasso: Preventing history forgery with secure provenance (2009) FAST, 9, pp. 1-14; Lyle, J., Martin, A., Trusted computing and provenance: Better together (2010) Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on the Theory and Practice of Provenance, , Usenix; Mozaffari-Kermani, M., Sur-Kolay, S., Raghunathan, A., Jha, N.K., Systematic poisoning attacks on and defenses for machine learning in healthcare (2015) IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, 19 (6), pp. 1893-1905. , (2015); Nelson, B., Barreno, M., Chi, F.J., Joseph, A.D., Rubinstein, B.I.P., Saini, U., Sutton, C., Xia, K., Misleading learners: Co-opting your spam filter (2009) Machine Learning in Cyber Trust, pp. 17-51. , Springer; Nelson, B., Barreno, M., Chi, F.J., Joseph, A.D., Rubinstein, B.I.P., Saini, U., Sutton, C.A., Xia, K., Exploiting machine learning to subvert your spam filter (2008) LEET, 8 (2008), pp. 1-9; Nelson, B.A., (2010) Behavior of Machine Learning Algorithms in Adversarial Environments, , University of California, Berkeley; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Sinha, A., Wellman, M., (2016) Towards the Science of Security and Privacy in Machine Learning, , arXiv preprint (2016); Rangwala, M., Liang, Z., Peng, W., Zou, X., Li, F., A mutual agreement signature scheme for secure data provenance (2014) Environments, 13 (2014), p. 14; Wang, X., Zeng, K., Govindan, K., Mohapatra, P., Chaining for securing data provenance in distributed information networks (2012) MILCOM 2012, pp. 1-6; Zhou, Y., Kantarcioglu, M., Thuraisingham, B., Xi, B., Adversarial support vector machine learning (2012) Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 1059-1067. , ACM",,,ACM SIGSAC,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","10th ACM Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Security, AISec 2017",3-Nov-17,,131803,,9.78145E+12,,,English,"AISec - Proc.

However, recent research on DNNs has indicated ever-increasing concern on the robustness to adversarial examples, especially for security-critical tasks such as traffic sign identification for autonomous driving. Studies have unveiled the vulnerability of a well-trained DNN by demonstrating the ability of generating barely noticeable (to both human and machines) adversarial images that lead to misclassification. Furthermore, researchers have shown that these adversarial images are highly transferable by simply training and attacking a substitute model built upon the target model, known as a black-box attack to DNNs. Similar to the setting of training substitute models, in this paper we propose an effective black-box attack that also only has access to the input (images) and the output (confidence scores) of a targeted DNN. However, different from leveraging attack transferability from substitute models, we propose zeroth order optimization (ZOO) based attacks to directly estimate the gradients of the targeted DNN for generating adversarial examples. We use zeroth order stochastic coordinate descent along with dimension reduction, hierarchical attack and importance sampling techniques to efficiently attack black-box models. By exploiting zeroth order optimization, improved attacks to the targeted DNN can be accomplished, sparing the need for training substitute models and avoiding the loss in attack transferability. Experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR10 and ImageNet show that the proposed ZOO attack is as effective as the state-of-the-art white-box attack (e.g., Carlini and Wagner's attack) and significantly outperforms existing black-box attacks via substitute models. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Adversarial learning; Black-box attack; Deep learning; Neural network; Substitute model,Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Deep learning; Importance sampling; Learning systems; Neural networks; Speech processing; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Text processing; Adversarial learning; Autonomous driving; Black boxes; Coordinate descent; Dimension reduction; Misclassifications; Order optimizations; State-of-the-art performance; Deep neural networks,,,,,"Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., The security of machine learning (2010) Machine Learning, 81 (2), pp. 121-148. , (2010); Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Joseph, A.D., Doug Tygar, J., Can machine learning be secure?

This exposes learning algorithms to the threat of data poisoning, i.e., a coordinate attack in which a fraction of the training data is controlled by the attacker and manipulated to subvert the learning process. To date, these attacks have been devised only against a limited class of binary learning algorithms, due to the inherent complexity of the gradient-based procedure used to optimize the poisoning points (a.k.a. adversarial training examples). In this work, we first extend the definition of poisoning attacks to multiclass problems. We then propose a novel poisoning algorithm based on the idea of back-gradient optimization, i.e., to compute the gradient of interest through automatic differentiation, while also reversing the learning procedure to drastically reduce the attack complexity. Compared to current poisoning strategies, our approach is able to target a wider class of learning algorithms, trained with gradient-based procedures, including neural networks and deep learning architectures. We empirically evaluate its effectiveness on several application examples, including spam filtering, malware detection, and handwritten digit recognition. We finally show that, similarly to adversarial test examples, adversarial training examples can also be transferred across different learning algorithms. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Adversarial examples; Adversarial machine learning; Deep learning; Training data poisoning,Artificial intelligence; Character recognition; Complex networks; Deep learning; Learning systems; Malware; Optimization; Adversarial examples; Application examples; Automatic differentiations; Gradient optimization; Handwritten digit recognition; Learning architectures; Multi-class problems; Training data; Learning algorithms,,,,,"Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Joseph, A., Tygar, J., The security of machine learning (2010) Machine Learning, 81 (2), pp. 121-148. , (2010); Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., Can machine learning be secure?

However, due to its non-linear architecture and high-dimensional inputs, its ill-posedness [1] towards adversarial perturbations - small deliberately crafted perturbations on the input will lead to completely different outputs, has also attracted researchers' attention. 1 This work takes the traffic sign recognition system on the selfdriving car as an example, and aims at designing an additional mechanism to improve the robustness of the recognition system. It uses a machine learning model which learns the results of the deep learning model's predictions, with human feedback as labels and provides the credibility of current prediction. The mechanism makes use of both the input image and the recognition result as the sample space, querying a human user the True/False of current classification result the least number of times, and completing the task of detecting adversarial attacks. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).",Active Learning; Adversarial Machine Learning; Deep Neural Network; Machine Learning Security; Support Vector Machine,Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Deep learning; Image recognition; Learning systems; Network security; Pattern recognition; Support vector machines; Traffic signs; Active Learning; Classification results; High-accuracy; High-dimensional; Learning models; Machine learning models; Recognition systems; Traffic sign recognition; Deep neural networks,,,,,"Haber, E., (2017) Stable Architectures for Deep Neural Networks., , http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03341, arXiv:1705.03341]; Timofte, R., Zimmermann, K., Gool, L., Multi-view traffic sign detection, recognition, and 3D localisation (2009) IEEE Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision, WACV; Nair, V., Hinton, G., Rectified linear units improve restricted Boltzmann machines (2010) Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML-10), pp. 807-814; Goodfellow, I.J., Shlens, J., Szegedy, C., Explaining and harnessing adversarial examples (2015) International Conference on Learning Representations; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Jha, S., Fredrikson, M., Celik, Z., (2015) The Limitations of Deep Learning in Adversarial Settings, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07528arXiv:1511.07528]; Kurakin, A., Goodfellow, I., (2015) Adversarial Examples in the Physical World, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02533arXiv:1607.02533]; LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., Haffner, P., (1998) Gradient-based Learning Applied to Document Recognition.

If attacker learnt those statistical difference and could produce some mimicking traffic which have little difference from traffic produced by legitimate uses in FC, which means existing methods will uselessness. In order to verify the existence of this possibility, this paper proposes an idea that employed Least Squares Generative Adversarial Networks (LSGANs) to generate mimicking traffic to make the defense system uselessness. By experiments evaluated, the proposed idea could mimicking traffic to fool the defense system. The proposed idea mainly focuses on traffic statistical information of each Bot and legitimate user, does not rely on network environments, so the possibility of this mimicking attack happened could be existed in other networks, such as wired network, wireless network and mobile network. © 2017 IEEE.",DDoS; Flash Crowds; LS-GAN; Mimicking Attack,Network security; Wireless networks; Adversarial networks; DDoS; Flash crowd; LS-GAN; Mimicking Attack; Network environments; Statistical differences; Statistical information; Network layers,,,,,"Networks, A., Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report, 2016; Yan, Q., Richard Yu, F., Gong, Q., Li, J., Software-defined networking (SDN) and distributed denial of service (ddos) attacks in cloud computing environments: A survey, some research issues, and challenges (2016) IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 18 (1), pp. 602-622; Somani, G., Singh Gaur, M., Sanghi, D., Conti, M., Buyya, R., Ddos attacks in cloud computing: Issues, taxonomy, and future directions (2017) Computer Communications, 107 (10), pp. 30-48; Cisco.

In this paper, two counter-jamming approaches are investigated for SKG systems: first, the employment of energy harvesting (EH) at the legitimate nodes to turn part of the jamming power into useful communication power, and, second, the use of channel hopping or power spreading in block fading channels to reduce the impact of jamming. In both cases, the adversarial interaction between the pair of legitimate nodes and the jammer is formulated as a two-player zero-sum game and the Nash and Stackelberg equilibria are characterized analytically and in closed form. In particular, in the case of EH receivers, the existence of a critical transmission power for the legitimate nodes allows the full characterization of the game's equilibria and also enables the complete neutralization of the jammer. In the case of channel hopping versus power spreading techniques, it is shown that the jammer's optimal strategy is always power spreading while the legitimate nodes should only use power spreading in the high signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) regime. In the low SIR regime, when avoiding the jammer's interference becomes critical, channel hopping is optimal for the legitimate nodes. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of both counter-jamming measures. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",channel hopping; energy harvesting; jamming; Secret key generation; zero-sum game,Cryptography; Energy harvesting; Fading channels; Game theory; Block fading channel; Channel hopping; Numerical results; Optimal strategies; Secret key generations; Spreading techniques; Transmission power; Zero-sum game; Jamming,,,,,"Belmega, E.V., Chorti, A., Energy harvesting in secret key generation systems under jamming attacks (2017) Proc.

In this paper, an alert correlation system capable of dealing with this problem is introduced. The work carried out has focused on the study of a particular family of sensors, namely those which analyze the payload of network traffic looking for malware. Unlike conventional approaches, the information provided by the network packet headers is not taken into account. Instead, the proposed strategy considers the payload of the monitored traffic and the characteristics of the models built during the training of such detectors, in this way supporting the general-purpose incident management tools. It aims to analyze, classify and prioritize alerts issued, based on two criteria: the risk of threats being genuine and their nature. Incidences are studied both in a one-to-one and in a group context. This implies the consideration of two different processing layers: The first one allows fast reactions and resilience against certain adversarial attacks, and on the other hand, the deeper layer facilitates the reconstruction of attack scenarios and provides an overview of potential threats. Experiments conducted by analyzing real traffic demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposal. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Alert correlation; Anomalies; Intrusion detection system; Malware; Network; Payload,Computer crime; Intrusion detection; Mercury (metal); Networks (circuits); Alert correlation; Anomalies; Conventional approach; Incident Management; Intrusion Detection Systems; Malicious activities; Network packet header; Payload; Malware,,,,,"Ahmadinejad, S.H., Jalili, S., Abadi, M., A hybrid model for correlating alerts of known and unknown attack scenarios and updating attack graphs (2011) Comput.

These systems are known as cyber-physical systems and due to their use of open computation and communication platform architectures, controlled cyber-physical systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this technical note, we propose a novel adaptive control architecture for addressing security and safety in cyber-physical systems. Specifically, we develop an adaptive controller that guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop dynamical system in the face of adversarial sensor and actuator attacks that are time-varying and partial asymptotic stability when the sensor and actuator attacks are time-invariant. Finally, we provide a numerical example to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed adaptive control architecture. © 2012 IEEE.",Actuator attacks; adaptive control; cyber-physical systems; partial asymptotic stability; sensor attacks; uniform ultimate boundedness,Actuators; Asymptotic stability; Cyber Physical System; Dynamical systems; Embedded systems; System stability; Adaptive Control; Adaptive control architecture; Adaptive controllers; Communication components; Communication platforms; Sensor and actuators; Technological advances; Uniform ultimate boundedness; Adaptive control systems,,,,,"Antsaklis, P., Goals, challenges in cyber-physical systems research (2014) IEEE Trans.

Interestingly, randomization has also been proposed to improve security of learning algorithms against evasion attacks, as it results in hiding information about the classifier to the attacker. Recent work has proposed game-theoretical formulations to learn secure classifiers, by simulating different evasion attacks and modifying the classification function accordingly. However, both the classification function and the simulated data manipulations have been modeled in a deterministic manner, without accounting for any form of randomization. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by proposing a randomized prediction game, namely, a noncooperative game-theoretic formulation in which the classifier and the attacker make randomized strategy selections according to some probability distribution defined over the respective strategy set. We show that our approach allows one to improve the tradeoff between attack detection and false alarms with respect to the state-of-the-art secure classifiers, even against attacks that are different from those hypothesized during design, on application examples including handwritten digit recognition, spam, and malware detection. © 2016 IEEE.",Adversarial learning; Computer security; Evasion attacks; Game theory; Pattern classification; Randomization,Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Character recognition; Computer crime; Game theory; Internet; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Malware; Probability distributions; Random processes; Application examples; Classification functions; Data manipulations; Handwritten digit recognition; Hiding informations; Noncooperative game; Randomized strategy; Theoretical formulation; Classification (of information),,,,,"Dalvi, N., Domingos, P., Sanghai, S., Verma, D., Adversarial classification (2004) Proc. 10th ACM SIGKDD Int.

Unfortunately, they are very difficult to foresee, detect, and defend against due to the trust and responsibilities placed on the employees. In this paper, we first define the notion of user intent, and construct a model for the most common threat scenario used in the literature that poses a very high risk for sensitive data stored in the organization's database. We show that the complexity of identifying pseudo-intents of a user is coNP-Complete in this domain, and launching a harvester insider attack within the boundaries of the defined threat model takes linear time while a targeted threat model is an NP-Complete problem. We also discuss about the general defense mechanisms against the modeled threats, and show that countering against the harvester insider attack model takes quadratic time while countering against the targeted insider attack model can take linear to quadratic time depending on the strategy chosen. Finally, we analyze the adversarial behavior, and show that launching an attack with minimum risk is also an NP-Complete problem. © 2017 ACM.",Complexity analysis; Insider threat; Query intent; Query logs; Threat modeling,Computational complexity; Harvesters; Information retrieval; Risk perception; Security systems; Complexity analysis; Insider Threat; Query intent; Query logs; Threat modeling; Query processing,,,,,"Agrawal, R., Bird, P., Grandison, T., Kiernan, J., Logan, S., Rjaibi, W., Extending relational database systems to automatically enforce privacy policies (2005) ICDE; Aligon, J., Golfarelli, M., Marcel, P., Rizzi, S., Turricchia, E., Similarity measures for OLAP sessions (2014) Knowledge and information systems (2014); Aouiche, K., Jouve, P.-E., Darmont, J., Clustering-based materialized view selection in data warehouses (2006) ADBIS; Babin, M.A., Kuznetsov, S.O., Recognizing Pseudo-intents is coNP-complete (2010) CLA; Bishop, M., Engle, S., Frincke, D.A., Gates, C., Greitzer, F.L., Peisert, S., Whalen, S., A risk management approach to the ""insider threat (2010) Insider Threats in Cyber Security (2010, pp. 115-137; Bishop, M., Gates, C., Defining the insider threat (2008) CSIIRW; (2014) 2014 U.S. State of Cybercrime Survey, , July 2014; Chandola, V., Banerjee, A., Kumar, V., Anomaly detection: A survey (2009) ACM computing surveys (CSUR), 41 (3), p. 15; Chandra, A.K., Merlin, P.M., Optimal implementation of conjunctive queries in relational data bases (1977) Proceedings of the ninth annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing.

In this paper, we examine the robustness of video analysis algorithms in adversarial settings. Specifically, we propose targeted attacks on two fundamental classes of video analysis algorithms, namely video classification and shot detection. We show that an adversary can subtly manipulate a video in such a way that a human observer would perceive the content of the original video, but the video analysis algorithm will return the adversary's desired outputs. We then apply the attacks on the recently released Google Cloud Video Intelligence API. The API takes a video file and returns the video labels (objects within the video), shot changes (scene changes within the video) and shot labels (description of video events over time). Through experiments, we show that the API generates video and shot labels by processing only the first frame of every second of the video. Hence, an adversary can deceive the API to output only her desired video and shot labels by periodically inserting an image into the video at the rate of one frame per second. We also show that the pattern of shot changes returned by the API can be mostly recovered by an algorithm that compares the histograms of consecutive frames. Based on our equivalent model, we develop a method for slightly modifying the video frames, in order to deceive the API into generating our desired pattern of shot changes. We perform extensive experiments with different videos and show that our attacks are consistently successful across videos with different characteristics. At the end, we propose introducing randomness to video analysis algorithms as a countermeasure to our attacks. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",,Social networking (online); Equivalent model; Human observers; Original videos; Shot detection; Targeted attacks; Video analysis; Video classification; Video events; Web services,,,,,"Martín, A., Andy, C., Ian, G., Ilya, M., Kunal, T., Li, Z., McMahan, H.B., Deep learning with differential privacy (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 308-318. , ACM; Sami, A.-E.-H., Nisarg, K., Joonseok, L., Paul, N., George, T., Balakrishnan, V., Sudheendra, V., (2016) Youtube-8m: A Large-scale Video Classification Benchmark, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.08675 (2016); Aishy, A., Amar, M., Eric, D., Reliable and fast structureoriented video noise estimation.

Our work highlights areas in adversarial machine learning that have not yet been addressed, speci.cally: Graph-based clustering techniques, and a global feature space where realistic attackers without perfect knowledge must be accounted for (by the defenders) in order to be practical. Even though less informed attackers can evade graph clustering with low cost, we show that some practical defenses are possible. © 2017 author(s).",Adversarial Machine Learning; DGA; Network Security; Unsupervised Learning,Artificial intelligence; Graphic methods; Learning systems; Unsupervised learning; Global feature; Graph clustering; Graph model; Graph-based clustering; Graph-based detection; Low costs; Security problems; State of the art; Network security,,,,,"Amazon Machine Learning, , https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning, Accessed in May 2017 (Accessed in May 2017); BigML, , https://bigml.com/, Accessed in May 2017 (Accessed in May 2017); Google Cloud Prediction API, , https://cloud.google.com/prediction/docs/, Accessed in May 2017 (Accessed in May 2017); IOC Bucket, , https://www.iocbucket.com/, Accessed in May 2017 (Accessed in May 2017); Microsoft Azure, , https://azure.microsoft.com, Accessed in May 2017 (Accessed in May 2017); OpenIOC DB, , https://openiocdb.com/, Accessed in May 2017 (Accessed in May 2017); PredictionIO, , http://prediction.io, Accessed in May 2017 (Accessed in May 2017); Antonakakis, M., Perdisci, R., Dagon, D., Lee, W., Feamster, N., Building a dynamic reputation system for DNS (2010) USENIX Security Symposium, pp. 273-290; Antonakakis, M., Perdisci, R., Nadji, Y., Vasiloglou, N., Abu-Nimeh, S., Lee, W., Dagon, D., From Throw-Away Trac to Bots: Detecting the rise of DGA-Based malware (2012) The 21st USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 12), pp. 491-506. , Presented as part of; Bader, J., (2017) Domain Generation Algorithms, 2017. , https://github.com/baderj/domaingenerationalgorithms; Bayer, U., Comparetti, P.M., Hlauschek, C., Kruegel, C., Kirda, E., Scalable, Behavior-Based Malware Clustering (2009) NDSS, 9, pp. 8-11. , Citeseer; Biggio, B., Pillai, I., Bulò, S.R., Ariu, D., Pelillo, M., Roli, F., Is data clustering in adversarial settings secure (2013) Proceedings of the 2013 ACM Workshop On Articial Intelligence and Security, pp. 87-98. , ACM; Biggio, B., Rieck, K., Ariu, D., Wressnegger, C., Corona, I., Giacinto, G., Roli, F., Poisoning behavioral malware clustering (2014) Proceedings of the 2014 Workshop On Articial Intelligent and Security Workshop, pp. 27-36. , ACM; Blondel, V.D., Guillaume, J.-L., Lambiotte, R., Lefebvre, E., Fast unfolding of communities in large networks (2008) Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment 2008, 10 (2008), p.

Existing techniques for detecting spam include predicting the trustworthiness of accounts and analyzing the content of these messages. However, advanced attackers can still successfully evade these defenses. Online social networks bring people who have personal connections or share common interests to form communities. In this paper, we first show that users within a networked community share some topics of interest. Moreover, content shared on these social network tend to propagate according to the interests of people. Dissemination paths may emerge where some communities post similar messages, based on the interests of those communities. Spam and other malicious content, on the other hand, follow different spreading patterns. In this paper, we follow this insight and present POISED, a system that leverages the differences in propagation between benign and malicious messages on social networks to identify spam and other unwanted content. We test our system on a dataset of 1.3M tweets collected from 64K users, and we show that our approach is effective in detecting malicious messages, reaching 91% precision and 93% recall. We also show that POISED's detection is more comprehensive than previous systems, by comparing it to three state-of-the-art spam detection systems that have been proposed by the research community in the past. POISED significantly outperforms each of these systems. Moreover, through simulations, we show how POISED is effective in the early detection of spam messages and how it is resilient against two well-known adversarial machine learning attacks. © 2017 author(s).",Communities of Interest; Information Diffusion; Online Social Networks; Parties of Interest; Spam Detection,Learning systems; Network security; Statistical tests; Communities of interest; Information diffusion; On-line social networks; Parties of Interest; Spam detection; Social networking (online),,,,,"Ahn, Y.-Y., Bagrow, J.P., Lehmann, S., Link communities reveal multiscale complexity in networks (2010) Nature, 466 (7307), pp. 761-764. , 2010; Aldecoa, R., Marín, I., Exploring the limits of community detection strategies in complex networks (2013) Scientific Reports, 3; Benevenuto, F., Magno, G., Rodrigues, T., Almeida, V., Detecting spammers on twitter (2010) Collaboration, Electronic Messaging, Anti-abuse and Spam Conference (CEAS), 6, p. 12; Biggio, B., Corona, I., Fumera, G., Giacinto, G., Roli, F., Bagging classifiers for fighting poisoning attacks in adversarial classification tasks (2011) InternationalWorkshop On Multiple Classifier Systems, pp. 350-359. , Springer; Biggio, B., Corona, I., Maiorca, D., Nelson, B., Šrndi, N., Laskov, P., Giacinto, G., Roli, F., Evasion attacks against machine learning at test time (2013) Joint European Conference On Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases, pp. 387-402. , Springer; Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I., Latent dirichlet allocation (2003) The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3 (2003), pp. 993-1022; Blondel, V.D., Guillaume, J., Lambiotte, R., Lefebvre, E., Fast unfolding of communities in large networks (2008) Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment 2008, 10 (2008), p.

These attacks have been studied under assumptions that the adversary has certain knowledge of either the target model internals, its training dataset or at least classification scores it assigns to input samples. In this paper, we investigate a much more constrained and realistic attack scenario wherein the target classifier is minimally exposed to the adversary, revealing only its final classification decision (e.g., reject or accept an input sample). Moreover, the adversary can only manipulate malicious samples using a blackbox morpher. That is, the adversary has to evade the targeted classifier by morphing malicious samples ""in the dark"". We present a scoring mechanism that can assign a real-value score which reflects evasion progress to each sample based on the limited information available. Leveraging on such scoring mechanism, we propose an evasion method-EvadeHC-and evaluate it against two PDF malware detectors, namely PDFrate and Hidost. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed evasion attacks are effective, attaining 100% evasion rate on the evaluation dataset. Interestingly, EvadeHC outperforms the known classifier evasion techniques that operate based on classification scores output by the classifiers. Although our evaluations are conducted on PDF malware classifiers, the proposed approaches are domain-agnostic and are of wider application to other learning-based systems. © 2017 author(s).",,Computer crime; Malware; Attack scenarios; Classification decision; Data manipulations; Domain agnostics; Experimental evaluation; Limited information; Target model; Training dataset; Classification (of information),,,,,"Guarnieri, C., Tanasi, A., Bremer, J., Schloesser, M., Cuckoo Sandbox: AMalware Analysis System, , http://www.cuckoosandbox.org/; Adobe Acrobat Reader: Vulnerability Statistics, , http://www.cvedetails.com/product/497, CVE Details; https://github.com/mzweilin/pdfrw, Modified pdfrw; Šrndi, N., Laskov, P., Mimicus: A Library for Adversarial Classifier Evasion, , https://github.com/srndic/mimicus; Maupin, P., PDFRW: A Pure Python Library That Reads and Writes PDFs, , https://github.com/pmaupin/pdfrw; Chenette, S., Malicious Documents Archive for Signature Testing and Research-Contagio Malware Dump, , http://contagiodump.blogspot.sg/2010/08; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., The security of machine learning (2010) Machine Learning (2010); Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Joseph, A.D., Doug Tygar, J., Can machine learning be secure (2006) ASIACCS; Biggio, B., Corona, I., Maiorca, D., Nelson, B., Šrndi, N., Laskov, P., Giacinto, G., Roli, F., Evasion attacks against machine learning at test time (2013) ECML-PKDD; Biggio, B., Fumera, G., Roli, F., Multiple classifier systems for adversarial classification tasks (2009) MCS; Biggio, B., Nelson, B., Laskov, P., (2012) Poisoning Attacks Against Support Vector Machines, , (2012); Brückner, M., Kanzow, C., Scheffer, T., Static prediction games for adversarial learning problems (2012) Journal of Machine Learning Research, , (2012); Cova, M., Kruegel, C., Vigna, G., Detection and analysis of drive-by-download attacks and malicious JavaScript code (2010) WWW; Goodfellow, I.J., Shlens, J., Szegedy, C., (2014) Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples, , (2014); He, K., Zhang, X., Ren, S., Sun, J., Delving deep into rectifiers: Surpassing human-level performance on imagenet classification (2015) ICCV; (2006) PDF Reference, Sixth Edition, Version 1.23., , Adobe Systems Incorporated (2006); Katz, J., Lindell, Y., (2014) Introduction to Modern Cryptography, , CRC Press; Laskov, P., Šrndi, N., Static detection of malicious JavaScriptbearing PDF documents (2011) ACSAC; Lee, K., Caverlee, J., Webb, S., Uncovering social spammers: Social honeypots+ machine learning (2010) SIGIR; Li, Q., Chang, E.-C., Security of public watermarking schemes for binary sequences (2002) Information Hiding; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Goodfellow, I., Jha, S., Berkay Celik, Z., Swami, A., Practical Black-Box Attacks against Machine Learning (2017) ASIACCS; Rieck, K., Trinius, P., Willems, C., Holz, T., Automatic analysis of malware behavior using machine learning (2011) Journal of Computer Security (2011); Selvaraj, K., Gutierres, N.F., The Rise of PDF Malware; Sharif, M., Bhagavatula, S., Bauer, L., Reiter, M.K., Accessorize to a crime: Real and stealthy attacks on state-of-the-art face recognition (2016) CCS; Shokri, R., Stronati, M., Shmatikov, V., Membership inference attacks against machine learning models (2017) IEEE S&P; Silver, D., Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search (2016) Nature, , (2016); Smutz, C., Stavrou, A., Malicious PDF detection using metadata and structural features (2012) ACSAC; Sommer, R., Paxson, V., Outside the closed world: On using machine learning for network intrusion detection (2010) IEEE S&P; Šrndi, N., Laskov, P., Detection of malicious pdf files based on hierarchical document structure (2013) NDSS; Šrndi, N., Laskov, P., Practical evasion of a learning-based classifier: A case study (2014) IEEE S&P; Taigman, Y., Yang, M., Ranzato, M., Wolf, L., Deepface: Closing the gap to human-level performance in face verification (2014) CVPR; Tramèr, F., Zhang, F., Juels, A., Reiter, M.K., Ristenpart, T., Stealing machine learning models via prediction apis (2016) USENIX Security; Vinyals, O., Kaiser, U., Koo, T., Petrov, S., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G., Grammar as a foreign language (2015) NIPS; Xu, W., Qi, Y., Evans, D., Automatically evading classifiers (2016) NDSS; Yang, C., Harkreader, R., Gu, G., Empirical evaluation and new design for fighting evolving Twitter spammers (2013) IEEE TIFS, , (2013)",,,ACM SIGSAC,Association for Computing Machinery,"24th ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security, CCS 2017",30 October 2017 through 3 November 2017,,131467,15437221,9.78145E+12,,,English,Proc ACM Conf Computer Commun Secur,Conference Paper,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041439918

Its success is due to a combination of recent algorithmic breakthroughs, increasingly powerful computers, and access to significant amounts of data. Researchers have also considered privacy implications of deep learning. Models are typically trained in a centralized manner with all the data being processed by the same training algorithm. If the data is a collection of users' private data, including habits, personal pictures, geographical positions, interests, and more, the centralized server will have access to sensitive information that could potentially be mishandled. To tackle this problem, collaborative deep learning models have recently been proposed where parties locally train their deep learning structures and only share a subset of the parameters in the attempt to keep their respective training sets private. Parameters can also be obfuscated via differential privacy (DP) to make information extraction even more challenging, as proposed by Shokri and Shmatikov at CCS'15. Unfortunately, we show that any privacy-preserving collaborative deep learning is susceptible to a powerful attack that we devise in this paper. In particular, we show that a distributed, federated, or decentralized deep learning approach is fundamentally broken and does not protect the training sets of honest participants. The attack we developed exploits the real-time nature of the learning process that allows the adversary to train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that generates prototypical samples of the targeted training set that was meant to be private (the samples generated by the GAN are intended to come from the same distribution as the training data). Interestingly, we show that record-level differential privacy applied to the shared parameters of the model, as suggested in previous work, is ineffective (i.e., record-level DP is not designed to address our attack). © 2017 author(s).",Collaborative Learning; Deep Learning; Privacy; Security,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Data privacy; Dynamic positioning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Adversarial networks; Classification accuracy; Collaborative learning; Differential privacies; Geographical positions; Information leakage; Security; Sensitive informations; Deep learning,,,,,"Abadi, M., Chu, A., Goodfellow, I., Brendan McMahan, H., Mironov, I., Talwar, K., Zhang, L., Deep learning with differential privacy (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 ACMSIGSAC Conference On Computer and Communications Security, pp. 308-318. , ACM; Abdulkader, A., Lakshmiratan, A., Zhang, J., (2016) Introducing DeepText: Facebook's Text Understanding Engine, 2016. , https://tinyurl.com/jj359dv; Arjovsky, M., Bottou, L., Towards principled methods for training generative adversarial networks (2017) 5th International Conference On Learning Representations (ICLR; Ateniese, G., Mancini, L.V., Spognardi, A., Villani, A., Vitali, D., Felici, G., Hacking smart machines with smarter ones: How to extract meaningful data from machine learning classifiers (2015) International Journal of Security and Networks, 10 (3), pp. 137-150. , https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.4447, 2015; Barthe, G., Fong, N., Gaboardi, M., Grégoire, B., Hsu, J., Strub, P.-Y., Advanced probabilistic couplings for differential privacy (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference On Computer and Communications Security, pp. 55-67. , ACM; Bengio, Y., (2009) Learning Deep Architectures for AI.

The security properties of the protocol must be preserved in the presence of adversarial behavior. The two classic adversary models considered are semi-honest (where the adversary follows the protocol specification but tries to learn more than allowed by examining the protocol transcript) and malicious (where the adversary may follow any arbitrary attack strategy). Protocols for semi-honest adversaries are often far more efficient, but in many cases the security guarantees are not strong enough. In this paper, we present a new efficient method for ""compiling"" a large class of protocols that are secure in the presence of semihonest adversaries into protocols that are secure in the presence of malicious adversaries. Our method assumes an honest majority (i.e., that t < n=2 where t is the number of corrupted parties and n is the number of parties overall), and is applicable to many semihonest protocols based on secret-sharing. In order to achieve high efficiency, our protocol is secure with abort and does not achieve fairness, meaning that the adversary may receive output while the honest parties do not. We present a number of instantiations of our compiler, and obtain protocol variants that are very efficient for both a small and large number of parties.We implemented our protocol variants and ran extensive experiments to compare them with each other. Our results show that secure computation with an honest majority can be practical, even with security in the presence of malicious adversaries.

Inc, Columbia University, United States","This tutorial covers a systematic overview of kleptography: Stealing information subliminally from black-box cryptographic implementations; and cliptography: Defending mechanisms that clip the power of kleptographic attacks via specification re-designs (without altering the underlying algorithms). Despite the laudatory history of development of modern cryptography, applying cryptographic tools to reliably provide security and privacy in practice is notoriously difficult. One fundamental practical challenge, guaranteeing security and privacy without explicit trust in the algorithms and implementations that underlie basic security infrastructure, remains. While the dangers of entertaining adversarial implementation of cryptographic primitives seem obvious, the ramifications of such attacks are surprisingly dire: It turns out that-in wide generality-adversarial implementations of cryptographic (both deterministic and randomized) algorithms may leak private information while producing output that is statistically indistinguishable from that of a faithful implementation. Such attacks were formally studied in Kleptography. Snowden revelations has shown us how security and privacy can be lost at a very large scale even when traditional cryptography seems to be used to protect Internet communication, when Kleptography was not taken into consideration. We first explain how the above-mentioned Kleptographic attacks can be carried out in various settings. We then introduce several simple but rigorous immunizing strategies that were inspired by folklore practical wisdoms to protect different algorithms from implementation subversion. Those strategies can be applied to ensure security of most of the fundamental cryptographic primitives such as PRG, digital signatures, public key encryptions against kleptographic attacks when they are implemented accordingly. Our new design principles may suggest new standardization methods that help reducing the threats of subverted implementation.We also hope our tutorial to stimulate a community-wise efforts to further tackle the fundamental challenge mentioned at the beginning.",Backdoor resistance; Cliptography; Cryptography; Implementation subversion; Kleptography; Steganography,Network security; Public key cryptography; Steganography; Cliptography; Cryptographic implementation; Cryptographic primitives; Implementation subversion; Internet communication; Kleptography; Public-key encryption; Security infrastructure; Cryptography,,,,,"Bellare, M., Jaeger, J., Kane, D., Mass-surveillance without the State: Strongly undetectable algorithm-substitution attacks (2015) ACM CCS, 15, pp. 1431-1440. , Indrajit Ray, Ninghui Li, Christopher Kruegel: (Eds.).

However, these assumptions may give rise to vulnerabilities if violated by smart adversaries. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to craft the input samples by modifying a certain fraction of input features as small as in order to bypass the decision boundary of widely used binary classifiers using Support Vector Machine (SVM). We show that our algorithm can reliably produce adversarial samples which are misclassified with 98% success rate while modifying 22% of the input features on average. Our goal is to evaluate the robustness of classification algorithms for high demensional network data by intentionally performing evasion attacks with carefully designed adversarial examples.

However, researchers found deep learning systems to be vulnerable to small, specially crafted perturbations that are imperceptible to humans. Such perturbations cause deep learning systems to mis-classify adversarial examples, with potentially dis-A strous consequences where safety or security is crucial. Prior de-fenses against adversarial examples either targeted specific attacks or were shown to be ineffective. We propose MagNet, a framework for defending neural network classifiers against adversarial examples. MagNet neither modifies the protected classifier nor requires knowledge of the process for generating adversarial examples. MagNet includes one or more separate detector networks and a reformer network. The detector networks learn to differentiate between normal and adversarial ex-A mples by approximating the manifold of normal examples. Since they assume no specific process for generating adversarial exam-ples, they generalize well. The reformer network moves adversar-ial examples towards the manifold of normal examples, which is effective for correctly classifying adversarial examples with small perturbation.We discuss the intrinsic difficulties in defending against whitebox attack and propose a mechanism to defend against gray-box attack. Inspired by the use of randomness in cryptography, we use diversity to strengthen MagNet. We show empirically that MagNet is effective against the most advanced state-of-the-art at-tacks in blackbox and graybox scenarios without sacrificing false positive rate on normal examples. © 2017 author(s).",,Learning systems;

By fusing the situation factors of attacker, defender and network environment, the capability of attacker and the exploitability rate of vulnerability were evaluated utilizing the real-time detected attack events, and the expected time-cost for attack-defense were further calculated. Then an attack prediction algorithm based on the dynamic Bayesian attack graph was designed to infer the follow-up attack actions. At last, the attack threat was quantified as the security risk situation from two levels of the hosts and the overall network. Experimental analysis indicates that the proposed method is suitable for the real adversarial network environment, and is able to predict the occurrence time of attack accurately and quantify the attack threat reasonably. © 2017, Editorial Board of Journal on Communications.

In security-related applications, e.g. facial recognition and fingerprint identification, an adversary misleads the pattern recognition system on purpose by manipulating training or test samples. Black-box attack is one of adversarial attacks which camouflages unseen samples to evade the detection with limited information on the system. Recently, there are a few studies on the robustness of machine learning, especially deep learning, under black-box attack. In this study, we investigate the security of the stacked autoencoder, which is one of the most famous models in deep learning against black-box attack. A training dataset generation method is proposed for a substitute model in black-box attack. By enquiring labels of samples from the target classifier, we train a model to approximate the target classifier. To have a better approximation to the decision boundary of the target classifier, a hybrid data generation method is adopted to increase the number of the training data. We generate new samples by combining both near and far away the decision boundary of the substitute model. The experiment results suggest that our proposed method downgrades the classifier in terms of accuracy more significantly than the existing one within less label query times. It shows the proposed method is more efficient to train a substitute model to approximate target classifier. © 2017 IEEE.",Adversary learning; Black-box attack; Deep learning; Evasion attack; Machine learning; Transferability,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Face recognition; Learning systems; Pattern recognition systems; Wavelet analysis; Adversary learning; Black boxes; Decision boundary; Evasion attack; Facial recognition; Fingerprint identification; Limited information; Transferability; Pattern recognition,,,,,"Goodfellow, I.J., Shlens, J., Szegedy, C., (2014) Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples, , arXiv preprint arXiv: 1412. 6572; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Jha, S., The limitations of deep learning in adversarial settings security and privacy (EuroS&P) (2016) 2016 IEEE European Symposium On.

However, there usually exist some intelligent attackers who intend to have malicious samples to be mis-classified as legitimate at test time, i.e. evasion attack. Current researches show that traditional Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are vulnerable to evasion attacks as they do not consider the existence of an attack. In this paper, we propose to increase the robustness of SVMs against evasion attacks by adding random generated malicious samples to the training set. The experimental result on spam filtering shows that the proposed method can increase the true positive rate of SVMs under evasion attacks without significantly affecting the false positive rate. © 2017 IEEE.",Adversarial learning; Evasion attack; Random noise; Support Vector Machine,Pattern recognition; Wavelet analysis; Adversarial learning; Evasion attack; False positive rates; Pattern recognition techniques; Random noise; Sensitive application; Support vector machine (SVMs); True positive rates; Support vector machines,,,,,"Kittler, J., Hatef, M., Duin, R.P., Matas, J., On combining classifiers (1998) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 20 (3), pp. 226-239; Ross, A.A., Nandakumar, K., Jain, A.K., (2006) Handbook of Multibiometrics, , Springer Publishers; Kemmerer, R.A., Vigna, G., Intrusion detection: A brief history and overview (supplement to computer magazine) (2002) Computer, 35, pp. 27-30; Meyer, T.A., Whateley, B., Spambayes: Effective open-source, Bayesian based, email classification system (2004) First Conference on Email and Anti-Spam (CEAS), , Mountain View, CA, USA July 30-31; Dalvi, N., Domingos, P., Mausam, S.S., Verma, D., Adversarial classification (2004) Tenth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), pp. 99-108. , Seattle; Gargiulo, F., Kuncheva, L.I., Sansone, C., Network protocol verification by a classifier selection ensemble (2009) MCS.

Its motivation is to learn feature from raw data. However, the performance of deep learning method applied to security-sensitive applications is poor. In adversarial environment, there are adversaries who attempt to evade valid classification by manipulating training and test samples. Thus, test data does not follow the same distribution of training data. Robustness of stacked autoencoder must be concerned under adversarial environment. In this paper, we investigate the attacking principle and try to improve the robustness of stacked autoencoder. A simple but effective objective function that not only minimizes empirical risks but also improves the robustness of stacked autoencoder against evasion attack is proposed. Our proposed method is based on weight evenness which presents better classification performance under evasion attack. We verify this method on the MNIST dataset. The robustness of our model is compared with conventional stacked autoencoder. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective against evasion attack and enhances the security of stacked autoencoder under adversarial environment. © 2017 IEEE.",Evasion Attack; Robustness; Weight Evenness,Deep learning; Pattern recognition; Robustness (control systems); Signal encoding; Wavelet analysis; Adversarial environments; Classification performance; Empirical risks; Evasion Attack; Learning methods; Objective functions; Sensitive application; Weight Evenness; Learning systems,,,,,"Cortes, C., Vapnik, V., Support-vector networks (1995) Machine Learning, 20 (3), pp. 273-297; Bengio, Y., Learning deep architectures for AI (2009) Foundations and Trends® in Machine Learning, 2 (1), pp. 1-127; Simonyan, K., Zisserman, A., (2014) Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-scale Image Recognition, , arXiv preprint arXiv: 1409. 1556; Szegedy, C., Going deeper with convolutions (2015) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.; He, K., Deep residual learning for image Wang (2016) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, , Ke, Janak J.

Furthermore, sensing accuracy is also essential for allocating vacant bands to the secondary users (SUs) for data transmission. Hence, this study focuses on designing an energy-efficient double threshold-based CRN. The adversarial effects arising in the presence of the attacker are analysed and are treated as constraints while formulating the energy efficiency (EE) maximisation problem. To develop the formulation, a unique SU selection algorithm to identify most eligible SUs for data transmission is proposed. The EE is then maximised by minimising the total power consumption through novel adaptive resource allocation algorithm. Hence, the authors proposed approaches are based on the suitable selection of SUs and adaptive power allocation under the constraints of maximum throughput, controlled transmission power providing sufficient protection to the primary user, minimum power consumption and minimum false alarm probability. The extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme substantially increases EE with lower complexity over the conventional scheme. © 2017, The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,Data transfer; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Resource allocation; Adaptive power allocation; Adaptive resource allocations; Cognitive radio network; Cognitive radio network (CRN); Extensive simulations; False alarm probability; Primary user emulation attack (PUEA); Total power consumption; Cognitive radio,,,,,"Akyildiz, I.F., Lee, W.-Y., Vuran, M.C., 'Next generation/dynamic spectrum access/cognitive radio wireless networks: a survey' (2006) Comput.

Due to the large number of communication devices and content, it is ideal that these cybersecurity solutions are automated. Unfortunately, malicious content and/or activity is often designed to 'look' normal and new malicious attacks are repeatedly being developed as older attacks become detectable. Furthermore, the amount of normal content is much greater than the amount of malicious content which creates an imbalance in the data. These adversarial issues create a particularly difficult environment for an automated detection system. In this research, we present a framework for an HTML malicious file detection system that uses various aspects of machine learning techniques (feature preprocessing, generating synthetic samples, ensemble classifiers, etc..) to mitigate the issue with data imbalance. Additionally, we analyze and compare the performance of various detection techniques used in our framework. © 2017 IEEE.",,HTML; Learning systems; Network function virtualization; Network security; Automated detection; Communication device; Cyber security; Data imbalance; Ensemble classifiers; File detections; Machine learning techniques; Malicious attack; Distributed computer systems,,,,,"Bosch, A., Bogers, T., Kunder, M., Estimating search engine index size variability: A 9-year longitudinal study (2016) Scientometrics, 107 (2), pp. 839-856; Evans, D., The internet of things: How the next evolution of the internet is changing everything (2011) CISCO White Paper, 1 (2011), pp. 1-11; Poor, H.V., (2013) An Introduction to Signal Detection and Estimation, , Springer Science & Business Media; Liu, F.T., Ting, K.M., Zhou, Z.-H., Isolation forest Data Mining 2008 ICDM08.

This work discusses the process of assessing and gaining confidence in the resilience of a consensus protocols exposed to faults and adversarial nodes. We advocate to follow the established practice in cryptography and computer security, relying on public reviews, detailed models, and formal proofs; the designers of several practical systems appear to be unaware of this.

The communication link is modelled as a set of transmission regimes controlled by a strategic jammer whose intention is to wage an attack on the plant by choosing a most damaging regime-switching strategy. We demonstrate that even in the one-step case, the introduced games admit a saddle-point equilibrium, at which the jammer's optimal policy is to randomize in a region of the plant's state space, thus requiring the controller to undertake a nontrivial response which is different from what one would expect in a standard stochastic control problem over a packet dropping link. The paper derives conditions for the introduced games to have such a saddle-point equilibrium. Furthermore, we show that in more general multi-stage games, these conditions provide ‘greedy’ jamming strategies for the adversary. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Adversarial zero-sum games; Control over adversarial channels; Control over packet-dropping links; Security of control systems,Control systems; Controllers; Denial-of-service attack; Game theory; Jamming; Packet loss; Stochastic control systems; Stochastic systems; Denial of Service; Jamming strategies; Multi stage games; Packet dropping; Regime switching; Saddle-point equilibriums; Stochastic control; Zero-sum game; Networked control systems,,,,,"Amin, S., Cárdenas, A., Sastry, S., Safe and secure networked control systems under denial-of-service attacks (2009) Hybrid systems: Computation and control, pp. 31-45; Başar, T., Olsder, G., (1982) Dynamic noncooperative game theory, , Academic Press; Boyd, S., Vandenberghe, L., (2003) Convex optimization, , Cambridge University Press; Gupta, A., Langbort, C., Başar, T., Optimal control in the presence of an intelligent jammer with limited actions (2010), pp. 1096-1101. , In Proc. 49th IEEE CDC (pp.); Imer, O., Yüksel, S., Başar, T., Optimal control of LTI systems over unreliable communication links (2006) Automatica, 42 (9), pp. 1429-1439; Langbort, C., Ugrinovskii, V., One-shot control over an AVC-like adversarial channel (2012), In Proc. of 2012 ACC, Montreal; Nair, G., Fagnani, F., Zampieri, S., Evans, R., Feedback control under data rate constraints: an overview (2007) Proceedings of the IEEE, 95 (1), pp. 108-137; Pelechrinis, K., Iliofotou, M., Krishnamurthy, S.V., Denial of service attacks in wireless networks: The case of jammers (2011) IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 13, pp. 245-257; Peressini, A.L., Sullivan, F.E., Uhl, J.J., (1988) The mathematics of nonlinear programming, , Springer-Verlag; Schenato, L., Sinopoli, B., Franceschetti, M., Poolla, K., Sastry, S., Foundations of control and estimation over lossy networks (2007) Proceedings of the IEEE, 95 (1), pp. 163-187; Tatikonda, S., Mitter, S., Control under communication constraints (2004) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 49 (7), pp. 1056-1068; Ugrinovskii, V., Langbort, C., Control over adversarial packet-dropping communication networks revisited (2014), In Proc. of 2014 ACC, Portland",,,,Elsevier Ltd,,,,,51098,,ATCAA,,English,Automatica,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027869143

We focus in particular on the regime in which the number of messages is fixed while the blocklength of the source and the size of each message tend to infinity. For this fixed-blocklength, 'large alphabet' channel, we show that combining an optimal rate-distortion code with an optimal error-correction code yields an optimal overall code for Gaussian sources with quadratic distortion and binary uniform sources with Hamming distortion but that it can be suboptimal by an arbitrarily large factor in general. We also consider the scenario in which the distortion constraint that the decoder must satisfy depends on the number of errors that occur. We show that the problem can be reduced operationally to one with erasures instead of errors in two special cases: One involving lossless reproduction of functions of the source and one in which the encoder and decoder share common randomness. © 2017 IEEE.",Adversarial channel; coding; lossy compression; man-in-the-middle attack; source-channel coding,Decoding; Distortion (waves); Electric distortion; Encoding (symbols); Errors; Network protocols; Optimal systems; Receivers (containers); Signal distortion; Adversarial channel; coding; Lossy compressions; Man in the middle attacks; Rate distortions; Security; Source channel coding; Codes (symbols),,,,,"Yeung, R.W., Cai, N., Network error correction, I: Basic concepts and upper bounds (2006) Commun.

Trust-based routing protocols have been proposed as a new approach to ensure reliable routing under adversarial MANET environment. In this paper, firstly, we adopt a systematic approach to examine those typical routing attacks existing in dynamic source routing (DSR) protocol, and study how the attackers can achieve their attacking goals by executing various malicious actions. Then we analyze the necessity of trust-based routing protocols by reviewing some conventional reliable routing schemes. Specifically, we survey the state of art of the trust-based routing protocols and utilize a general framework that allows for analyzing most of them easily. Finally, we provide a comparison of these existing trust-based routing protocols based on a general framework. Our work contributes to understanding (1) how those attackers achieve their goals by disobeying the DSR regulations (2) what are the basic mechanisms when designing trust-based routing protocol and (3) the strengths and vulnerabilities of different design components. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Attacker; Compromised node; Mobile ad hoc networks; Trust-based routing,Network routing; Routing protocols; Attacker; Compromised nodes; Design Component; Dynamic Source Routing Protocol; Mobile adhoc network (MANETs); Reliable routing; Routing attacks; Trust-based routing; Mobile ad hoc networks,,,,,"Perkins, C.E., Belding-Royer, E.M., Das, S.R., Ad hoc on demand distance vector (AODV) routing: IETF RFC 3561 (2003) July, p. 2003; Johnson, D.B., Maltz, D.A., Hu, Y.C., Jetcheva, J.G., The dynamic source routing protocol for mobile ad hoc networks (DSR): IETF RFC 4728 (2007) February, p. 2007; Pradip, M., Jawandhiya, M.M.G., Ali, M.S., Deshpande, M.S., A survey of mobile ad hoc network attacks (2010) International Journal of Engineering Science and Technology, 2 (9), pp. 4063-4071; (2007) A survey of attacks and countermeasures in mobile ad hoc networks.

However, security service is crucial to these protocols when sensor nodes are deployed in adversarial environments. Existing security schemes can resist Pollution Attack, but the overheads are excessive. In this paper, a security enhancement approach with low overhead based on Hierarchical Hash Tree is proposed to enhance the security of the protocols. Our scheme is composed of two layers of Merkle Tree based on the ideas of hierarchy and aggregation. Then, the security of proposed approach is proven and the overheads of that are analyzed. Furthermore, our scheme is used to implement page authentication of Sreluge protocol, which is a representative reprogramming protocol based on random linear codes. Experimental results show that our scheme can cut authentication overhead by at least 43 % that of Merkle Tree and other overheads have been reduced markedly with the size of code image growing. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Coding-based reprogramming protocols; Hierarchical hash tree; Page authentication; Random linear codes; Security enhancement approach; Wireless sensor networks,Authentication; Codes (symbols); Data structures; Image coding; Network coding; Network protocols; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Adversarial environments; Hash trees; Pollution attack; Random linear codes; Reprogramming protocols; Security enhancements; Security services; Wireless channel; Network security,,,,,"Hou, I.H., Tsai, Y.E., Abdelzaher, T.F., Gupta, I., Adapcode: Adaptive network coding for code updates in wireless sensor networks (2008) IEEE Conf. on Computer Commun.

Among the various adversarial attacks, MITC (Man in the Cloud) attack on commercial cloud storage applications has emerged as a critical threat because it is easy to launch and hard to detect. In this paper, we propose MITC Defender, a hardware-based defense system capable of protecting client user credentials using Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) and preventing against four different types of MITC attack in cloud environment. By adopting Intel SGX security features such as sealing and attestation, MITC Defender can securely seal user credentials locally and easily unseal user credentials, when verifications are needed, in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). We implement MITC Defender on an open source platform OpenSGX and evaluate the performance and potential overhead. Our evaluation results show that MITC Defender is effective on defense against MITC attack and other security threats with a low cost. © 2017 IEEE.",attestation; credential protection; Intel SGX; isolated execution; MITC attack; Trusted Execution Environment,Network security; Open source software; Security systems; attestation; credential protection; Intel SGX; isolated execution; MITC attack; Trusted execution environments; Cloud computing,,,,,"Liang, X., Shetty, S., Tosh, D., Kamhoua, C., Kwiat, K., Njilla, L., Provchain: A blockchain-based data provenance architecture in cloud environment with enhanced privacy and availability (2017) International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing.

Such a usage gap occurs mainly due to the difficulty to maintain the detection rate in acceptable level, given the occurrence of false alarms. In general, the literature does not consider the adversarial settings, when an opponent attempt to evade the detection system, thus possibly rendering the system unreliable over time. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a new approach to reliably perform real time stream learning for anomaly-based intrusion detection. We employ a class-specific stream outlier detector to automatically update the intrusion detection engine over the time, and a rejection mechanism, which makes it possible to obtain indications that an evasion attempt might being happening. Furthermore, the proposal is resilient to causative attacks, providing a secure intrusion detection mechanism even when the attacker can inject misclassified instances in the training dataset. The evaluation tests show that the proposed approach is resilient to exploratory attacks, allowing the system administrator to know when an evasion attempt might be occurring. © 2017 IEEE.",Adversarial Settings; Intrusion Detection; Outlier Detection; Stream Learning,Mercury (metal); Statistics; Anomaly-based intrusion detection; Detection system; Outlier Detection; Production environments; Real-time streams; Rejection mechanisms; Stream Learning; System administrators; Intrusion detection,,,,,"García-Teodoro, P., Díaz-Verdejo, J., Maciá-Ferná Ndez, G., Vá Zquez, E., Anomaly-based network intrusion detection: Techniques, systems and challenges (2009) Comput.

The wireless SGN (WSGNs) have enabled numerous flexible power management solutions without the restrictions of the wired infrastructure. The cognitive radio network (CRN) is one of the widely deployed wireless networking approaches. The communication security is a major concern while CRN is used in WSGNs. Currently, jamming and spoofing are two common attack approaches that are active in the deployment of WSGNs when using CRNs. This paper proposes an attack strategy, maximum attacking strategy using spoofing and jamming (MASS-SJ), which utilizes an optimal power distribution to maximize the adversarial effects. Spoofing and jamming attacks are launched in a dynamic manner in order to interfere with the maximum number of signal channels. Our proposed approach has been evaluated by our experiments and the results have shown the positive performance of using MAS-SJ. © 2017 IEEE.",Attack strategy; jamming; optimal power distribution; spoofing; wireless smart grid network,Cognitive radio; Electric power transmission networks; Jamming; Wireless networks; Attack strategies; Attacking strategy; Cognitive radio network (CRN); Governance systems; Optimal power; Smart grid networks; spoofing; Wireless networking; Smart power grids,,,,,"Fateh, B., Govindarasu, M., Ajjarapu, V., Wireless network design for transmission line monitoring in smart grid (2013) IEEE Trans.

This adversarial nature makes security applications different from the classical machine learning problems; for instance, an adversary (attacker) might change the distribution of test data and violate the data stationarity, a common assumption in machine learning techniques. Since machine learning methods are not inherently adversary-aware, a classifier designer should investigate the robustness of a learning system under attack. In this respect, recent studies have modeled the identified attacks against machine learning-based detection systems. Based on this, a classifier designer can evaluate the performance of a learning system leveraging the modeled attacks. Prior research explored a gradient-based approach in order to devise an attack against a classifier with differentiable discriminant function like SVM. However, there are several powerful classifiers with non-differentiable decision boundary such as Random Forest, which are commonly used in different security domain and applications. In this paper, we present a novel approach to model an attack against classifiers with non-differentiable decision boundary. In the experimentation, we first present an example that visually shows the effect of a successful attack on the MNIST handwritten digits classification task. Then we conduct experiments for two well-known applications in the security domain: spam filtering and malware detection in PDF files. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed attack successfully evades Random Forest classifier and effectively degrades the classifier’s performance. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Discriminant function; Evasion attack; Machine learning; Security application; Surrogate classifier,Artificial intelligence; Character recognition; Computer crime; Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Function evaluation; Malware; Classification tasks; Discriminant functions; Evasion attack; Machine learning methods; Machine learning problem; Machine learning techniques; Random forest classifier; Security application; Learning systems,,,,,"Warrender, C., Forrest, S., Pearlmutter, B., Detecting intrusions using system calls: Alternative data models (1999) Security and Privacy, 1999.

Nonetheless, the manual production of adversarial samples is painful and labor intensive. Here we propose a novel generative model: Convolutional Autoencoder Model to add unsupervised adversarial training, i.e., the production of adversarial images from the encoded feature representation, on conventional supervised convolutional neural network training. To accomplish such objective, we first provide a novel statistical understanding of convolutional neural network to translate convolution and pooling computations equivalently as a hierarchy of encoders, and sampling tricks, respectively. Then, we derive our proposed Convolutional Autoencoder Model with the 'adversarial decoders' to automate the generation of adversarial samples.

However, as NFC technology becomes pervasive, there have been concerns about how well NFC-enabled contactless payment systems protect individuals and organizations from emerging security and privacy threats. In this paper, we examine the security of contactless payment systems by considering the privacy threats and the different adversarial attacks that these systems must defend against. We focus our analysis on the underlying trust assumptions, security measures and technologies that form the basis on which contactless payment cards and NFC-enabled mobile wallets exchange sensitive transaction data with contactless POS terminals. We also explore the EMV and ISO standards for contactless payments and disclose their shortcomings with regards to enforcing security and privacy in contactless payment transactions. Our findings shed light on the discrepancies between the EMV and ISO standards, as well as how card issuing banks and mobile wallet providers configure their contactless payment cards and NFC-enabled mobile wallets based on these standards, respectively. these inconsistencies are disconcerting as they can be exploited by an adversary to compromise the integrity of contactless payment transactions. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Contactless payments; Mobile payments; Mobile wallets; Near field communication; NFC technology,Electronic commerce; Mobile telecommunication systems; Near field communication; Point of sale terminals; Standards; Contactless payment; Mobile payment; Mobile wallets; Nfc technologies; Security and privacy; The near field communication (NFC); Transaction data; Trust assumptions; Electronic money,,,,,"(2015) EMV and NFC: Complementary Technologies Enabling Secure Contactless Payments, , https://www.securetechalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/EMV-and-NFC-WP-Final-Nov-2015.pdf, Smart Card Alliance.

Many of these images have been modified and are not authentic. Recent advances in the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have facilitated the task of analyzing the veracity and authenticity of largely distributed image datasets. We examine in this paper the problem of identifying the camera model or type that was used to take an image and that can be spoofed. Due to the linear nature of CNNs and the high-dimensionality of images, neural networks are vulnerable to attacks with adversarial examples. These examples are imperceptibly different from correctly classified images but are misclassified with high confidence by CNNs. In this paper, we describe a counter-forensic method capable of subtly altering images to change their estimated camera model when they are analyzed by any CNN-based camera model detector. Our method can use both the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) or the Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA) to craft these adversarial images and does not require direct access to the CNN. Our results show that even advanced deep learning architectures trained to analyze images and obtain camera model information are still vulnerable to our proposed method. © 2017 IEEE.",,Cameras; Computer vision;

Automated video annotation would be a breakthrough technology, enabling users to search within the videos. Recently, Google introduced the Cloud Video Intelligence API for video analysis. As per the website, the system can be used to 'separate signal from noise, by retrieving relevant information at the video, shot or per frame' level. A demonstration website has been also launched, which allows anyone to select a video for annotation. The API then detects the video labels (objects within the video) as well as shot labels (description of the video events over time). In this paper, we examine the usability of the Google's Cloud Video Intelligence API in adversarial environments. In particular, we investigate whether an adversary can subtly manipulate a video in such a way that the API will return only the adversary-desired labels. For this, we select an image, which is different from the video content, and insert it, periodically and at a very low rate, into the video. We found that if we insert one image every two seconds, the API is deceived into annotating the video as if it only contained the inserted image. Note that the modification to the video is hardly noticeable as, for instance, for a typical frame rate of 25, we insert only one image per 50 video frames. We also found that, by inserting one image per second, all the shot labels returned by the API are related to the inserted image. We perform the experiments on the sample videos provided by the API demonstration website and show that our attack is successful with different videos and images. © 2017 IEEE.",,Computer vision; Websites; Adversarial environments; Automated video; Breakthrough technology; Video analysis; Video annotations; Video contents; Video events; Video frame; Pattern recognition,,,,,"Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G.E., Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (2012) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 1097-1105; Simonyan, K., Zisserman, A., (2014) Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-scale Image Recognition, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1409. 1556; Girshick, R., Donahue, J., Darrell, T., Malik, J., Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation (2014) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 580-587; He, K., Zhang, X., Ren, S., Sun, J., Deep residual learning for image recognition (2016) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 770-778; Vondrick, C., Ramanan, D., Patterson, D., Efficiently scaling up video annotation with crowdsourced marketplaces (2010) Computer Vision-ECCV 2010, pp. 610-623; Zha, Z.-J., Wang, M., Zheng, Y.-T., Yang, Y., Hong, R., Chua, T.-S., Interactive video indexing with statistical active learning (2012) IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 14 (1), pp. 17-27; Wang, M., Ni, B., Hua, X.-S., Chua, T.-S., Assistive tagging: A survey of multimedia tagging with human-computer joint exploration (2012) ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 44 (4), p. 25; Wang, M., Hua, X.-S., Hong, R., Tang, J., Qi, G.-J., Song, Y., Unified video annotation via multigraph learning (2009) IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, 19 (5), pp. 733-746; Wang, M., Hua, X.-S., Tang, J., Hong, R., Beyond distance measurement: Constructing neighborhood similarity for video annotation (2009) IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 11 (3), pp. 465-476; Zhang, T., Xu, C., Zhu, G., Liu, S., Lu, H., A generic framework for video annotation via semi-supervised learning (2012) IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 14 (4), pp. 1206-1219; https://code.facebook.com/posts/804694409665581/powering-facebookexperiences-with-ai/; https://blog.twitter.com/2016/increasing-our-investment-in-machinelearning; https://cloud.google.com/blog/bigdata/2017/03/announcing-google-cloudvideo-intelligence-api-and-more-cloudmachine-learning-updates; https://cloud.google.com/videointelligence/#demo; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., Can machine learning be secure (2006) Proceedings of the 2006 ACM Symposium on Information, Computer and Communications Security, pp. 16-25. , ACM; Huang, L., Joseph, A.D., Nelson, B., Rubinstein, B.I., Tygar, J., Adversarial machine learning (2011) Proceedings of the 4th ACM Workshop on Security and Artificial Intelligence, pp. 43-58. , ACM; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Jha, S., Fredrikson, M., Celik, Z.B., Swami, A., The limitations of deep learning in adversarial settings (2016) Security and Privacy (EuroS&P), 2016 IEEE European Symposium on, pp. 372-387. , IEEE; Amodei, D., Olah, C., Steinhardt, J., Christiano, P., Schulman, J., Mané, D., (2016) Concrete Problems in Ai Safety, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1606. 06565; Carlini, N., Mishra, P., Vaidya, T., Zhang, Y., Sherr, M., Shields, C., Wagner, D., Zhou, W., Hidden voice commands (2016) 25th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 16), , Austin, TX; Sharif, M., Bhagavatula, S., Bauer, L., Reiter, M.K., Accessorize to a crime: Real and stealthy attacks on state-ofthe-art face recognition (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 1528-1540. , ACM; Hosseini, H., Kannan, S., Zhang, B., Poovendran, R., (2017) Deceiving Google's Perspective Api Built for Detecting Toxic Comments, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1702. 08138",,,,IEEE Computer Society,"30th IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, CVPRW 2017",21 July 2017 through 26 July 2017,,130113,21607508,9.78154E+12,,,English,IEEE Comput.

However, these networks have also been shown susceptible to crafted adversarial perturbations which force misclassification of the inputs. Adversarial examples enable adversaries to subvert the expected system behavior leading to undesired consequences and could pose a security risk when these systems are deployed in the real world. In this work, we focus on deep convolutional neural networks and demonstrate that adversaries can easily craft adversarial examples even without any internal knowledge of the target network. Our attacks treat the network as an oracle (black-box) and only assume that the output of the network can be observed on the probed inputs. Our attacks utilize a novel local-search based technique to construct numerical approximation to the network gradient, which is then carefully used to construct a small set of pixels in an image to perturb. We demonstrate how this underlying idea can be adapted to achieve several strong notions of misclassification. The simplicity and effectiveness of our proposed schemes mean that they could serve as a litmus test for designing robust networks. © 2017 IEEE.",,Computer crime; Computer vision; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Speech recognition; Convolutional neural network; Language processing; Learning models; Misclassifications; Numerical approximations; Robust network; State of the art; System behaviors; Deep neural networks,,,,,"Abadi, M., Chu, A., Goodfellow, I., McMahan, H.B., Mironov, I., Talwar, K., Zhang, L., Deep learning with differential privacy (2016) ACM CCS; Benenson, R., (2016) What is the Class of This Image, , http://rodrigob.github.io/are_we_there_yet/build/classification_datasets_results.html; Biham, E., Shamir, A., Differential cryptanalysis of deslike cryptosystems (1991) Journal of CRYPTOLOGY, 4 (1), pp. 3-72; Chatfield, K., Simonyan, K., Vedaldi, A., Zisserman, A., (2014) Caffe Model Description: VGG CNN S, , https://gist.github.com/ksimonyan/fd8800eeb36e276cd6f9; Chatfield, K., Simonyan, K., Vedaldi, A., Zisserman, A., Return of the devil in the details: Delving deep into convolutional nets (2014) BMVC; Fawzi, A., Fawzi, O., Frossard, P., (2015) Analysis of Classifiers' Robustness to Adversarial Perturbations, , CoRR, abs/1502. 02590; Fawzi, A., Moosavi-Dezfooli, S.-M., Frossard, P., (2016) Robustness of Classifiers: From Adversarial to Random Noise, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1608. 08967; Goodfellow, I., Bengio, Y., Courville, A., (2016) Deep Learning, , Book in preparation for MIT Press; Goodfellow, I.J., Shlens, J., Szegedy, C., Explaining and harnessing adversarial examples (2015) ICLR; Grosse, K., Papernot, N., Manoharan, P., Backes, M., McDaniel, P., (2016) Adversarial Perturbations Against Deep Neural Networks for Malware Classification, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1606. 04435; Gu, S., Rigazio, L., Towards deep neural network architectures robust to adversarial examples (2015) ICLR Workshop; Ioffe, S., Szegedy, C., Batch normalization: Accelerating deep network training by reducing internal covariate shift (2015) ICML, pp. 448-456; Kurakin, A., Goodfellow, I., Bengio, S., (2016) Adversarial Examples in the Physical World, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1607. 02533; Lenstra, J.K., (1997) Local Search in Combinatorial Optimization, , Princeton University Press; Lin, M., Chen, Q., Yan, S., Network in network (2014) ICLR; Liu, Y., Chen, X., Liu, C., Song, D., (2016) Delving into Transferable Adversarial Examples and Black-box Attacks, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1611. 02770; McDaniel, P., Papernot, N., Celik, Z.B., Machine learning in adversarial settings (2016) IEEE Security & Privacy, 14 (3), pp. 68-72; Moosavi-Dezfooli, S.-M., Fawzi, A., Frossard, P., Deepfool: A simple and accurate method to fool deep neural networks (2016) CVPR; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Goodfellow, I., (2016) Transferability in Machine Learning: From Phenomena to Black-box Attacks Using Adversarial Samples, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1605. 07277; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Goodfellow, I., Jha, S., Berkay Celik, Z., Swami, A., Practical black-box attacks against deep learning systems using adversarial examples (2017) ACM Asia CCS; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Jha, S., Fredrikson, M., Celik, Z.B., Swami, A., The limitations of deep learning in adversarial settings (2016) 2016 IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS&P), pp. 372-387. , IEEE; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Wu, X., Jha, S., Swami, A., Distillation as a defense to adversarial perturbations against deep neural networks (2016) IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy; Ren, S., He, K., Girshick, R.B., Sun, J., Faster R-CNN: Towards real-time object detection with region proposal networks (2015) NIPS, pp. 91-99; Simonyan, K., Vedaldi, A., Zisserman, A., Deep inside convolutional networks: Visualising image classification models and saliency maps (2014) ICLR Workshop; Simonyan, K., Zisserman, A., (2014) Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-scale Image Recognition, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1409. 1556; Szegedy, C., Zaremba, W., Sutskever, I., Bruna, J., Erhan, D., Goodfellow, I., Fergus, R., Intriguing properties of neural networks (2014) ICLR; Tramèr, F., Zhang, F., Juels, A., Reiter, M.K., Ristenpart, T., (2016) Stealing Machine Learning Models Via Prediction Apis, , Usenix Security; Zagoruyko, S., (2015) Cifar-10 in Torch, , http://torch.ch/blog/2015/07/30/cifar.html; Zagoruyko, S., (2016) Are Deep Learning Algorithms Easily Hackable, , http://coxlab.github.io/ostrichinator; Zagoruyko, S., (2016), https://github.com/szagoruyko/loadcaffe",,,,IEEE Computer Society,"30th IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, CVPRW 2017",21 July 2017 through 26 July 2017,,130113,21607508,9.78154E+12,,,English,IEEE Comput.

In cybersecurity, an increasing number of companies have begun exploring the use of deep learning (DL) in a variety of security tasks with malware detection among the more popular. These companies claim that deep neural networks (DNNs) could help turn the tide in the war against malware infection. However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial samples, a shortcoming that plagues most, if not all, statistical and machine learning models. Recent research has demonstrated that those with malicious intent can easily circumvent deep learning-powered malware detection by exploiting this weakness. To address this problem, previous work developed defense mechanisms that are based on augmenting training data or enhancing model complexity. However, after analyzing DNN susceptibility to adversarial samples, we discover that the current defense mechanisms are limited and, more importantly, cannot provide theoretical guarantees of robustness against adversarial sampled-based attacks. As such, we propose a new adversary resistant technique that obstructs attackers from constructing impactful adversarial samples by randomly nullifying features within data vectors. Our proposed technique is evaluated on a real world dataset with 14,679 malware variants and 17,399 benign programs. We theoretically validate the robustness of our technique, and empirically show that our technique significantly boosts DNN robustness to adversarial samples while maintaining high accuracy in classification.

Node capture is one of the prominent attack in such networks. Whenever, a node is captured, its keys have to be revoked from the network by means of rekeying. We aim to optimize the problem of key revocation and rekeying by reducing the communication and computation overhead. An attack algorithm is presented from an adversarial view point, compromising of capturing cost and traveling cost. It is used to compute the destructive rank of each node which ultimately finds the set of vulnerable nodes of the network. Each communicating node determine a backup key for future node revocation and automatically switches to it, to avoid the reconfiguration of the shared key. The keys of vulnerable nodes are bypassed during the generation of the backup link keys. It is shown that proposed scheme has high level of security as well as reduced communication overhead during rekeying process. The proposed attack is also compared with random attack and found that it is improved in terms of route compromise ratio and energy cost. © 2017 IEEE.",Node capture attack; Node revocation; Random key predistribution; Rekeying,Cost reduction; Costs; Wireless sensor networks; Communication overheads; Computation overheads; Key revocation; Node capture attack; Node revocation; Random key distribution; Random key predistribution; Re-keying; Sensor nodes,,,,,"Aikyildiz, I.F., Su, W., Sankarasubramaniam, Cayir, E., Wireless sensor networks: A survey (2002) Computer Networks, 38 (4), pp. 393-422; He, X., Niedermeier, M., De Meer, H., Dynamic key management in wireless sensor networks: A survey (2013) Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 36 (2), pp. 611-622; Xiao, Y., Rayi, V.K., Sun, B., Du, X., Hu, F., Galloway, M., A survey of key management schemes in wireless sensor networks (2007) Computer Communications, 30 (11), pp. 2314-2341; Eltoweissy, M., Moharrum, M., Mukkamala, R., Dynamic key management in sensor networks (2006) IEEE Communications Magazine, 44 (4), pp. 122-130; Zhang, J., Varadharajan, Wireless sensor network key management survey and taxonomy (2010) Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 33, pp. 63-75; Biswas, S., Haque, M.M., Rashwand, S., Misic, J., Fast, seamless rekeying in wireless sensor networks (2009) Distributed Computing Systems Workshops, 2009.

Such opportunities can also represent an adversarial target, if his objective is to block the RF system from using such opportunities opened by spectrum holes. In this paper, we explore the challenge of finding spectrum holes in an adversarial environment. First, by means of a simple model, we show that an adversary's attack designed to close spectrum holes can be more harmful for the spectrum holes than just random jamming. This calls for designing a scanning strategy to detect such an attack. Second, by applying a game-theoretical model, we design the optimal scanning strategy to detect such attacks. In particular, we show the efficiency of such a scanning strategy compared with uninformed random scanning. This efficiency is achieved by focusing scanning efforts on the bands that will be more likely under attack, and neglecting less promising bands. Beyond the benefits, though, such a strategy has also drawbacks since, if the adversary has a different objective, such as sneaking usage of the spectrum, he can sneak usage undetected by using the bands neglected by such specially tuned scanning. To deal with this problem, third, we suggest to combine this strategy with a strategy that maximizes detection probability in a learning algorithm that updates the beliefs about the adversary's objective. The convergence of the combined algorithm is proven. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",Bayes methods; Intrusion detection; wireless networks,Efficiency; Game theory; Intrusion detection; Wireless networks; Adversarial environments; Bayes method; Combined algorithms; Detection probabilities; Game theoretical models; Radio frequencies; Scanning strategies; Simple modeling; Scanning,,,,,"Tandra, R., Mishra, S.M., Sahai, A., What is a spectrum hole and what does it take to recognize one (2009) Proc.

Therefore, developing the strategic reasoning abilities of cybersecurity students is an important cybersecurity education learning objective. This paper proposes that basic game theory concepts should be taught to cybersecurity students in order to improve their strategic reasoning abilities. It details a pretest-posttest educational experiment that demonstrates that 2 h of basic game theory instruction results in a statistically significant improvement in students' abilities to anticipate the strategic actions of others. It also provides details of the game theory curriculum to help other cybersecurity educators replicate these results. Additionally, this paper suggests that another benefit of teaching game theory in a cybersecurity course is that it may fundamentally alter the way students view the practice of cybersecurity, helping to sensitize them to the human adversary element inherent in cybersecurity in addition to technology-focused best practices. This could result in a more naturally strategic-minded, and therefore better equipped, cybersecurity workforce. © 2016 IEEE.",Adversarial thinking; cybersecurity; experimental research; game theory; higher education; learning objectives; professional skills; strategic reasoning,Curricula; Education; Education computing; Personal computing; Students; Teaching; Best practices; Cyber security; Cyber-security educations; Educational experiment; Learning objectives; Strategic reasoning; Theory concept; Game theory,,,,,"Hamman, S., Hopkinson, K., Teaching adversarial thinking for cybersecurity (2016) J.

This simple webservice is quite useful as it allows queries like whether a certain position of a target chromosome has a specific nucleotide. However, the increased integration of individuals genomic data into clinical practice and research raised serious privacy concern. Though the answer of such queries are yes or no in Bacon network, it results in serious privacy implication as demonstrated in a recent work from Shringarpure and Bustamante. In their attack model, the authors demonstrated that with a limited number of queries, presence of an individual in any dataset can be determined. Methods: We propose two lightweight algorithms (based on randomized response) which captures the efficacy while preserving the privacy of the participants in a genomic beacon service. We also elaborate the strength and weakness of the attack by explaining some of their statistical and mathematical models using real world genomic database. We extend their experimental simulations for different adversarial assumptions and parameters. Results: We experimentally evaluated the solutions on the original attack model with different parameters for better understanding of the privacy and utility tradeoffs provided by these two methods. Also, the statistical analysis further elaborates the different aspects of the prior attack which leads to a better risk management for the participants in a beacon service. Conclusions: The differentially private and lightweight solutions discussed here will make the attack much difficult to succeed while maintaining the fundamental motivation of beacon database network. © 2017 The Author(s).",Bustamante attack; Bustamante attack mitigation; GA4GH genomic beacon; Genomic beacon service; Human genomic data privacy; Re-identification attack,algorithm; Article; computer security; genetic database; genetic privacy; genomics; mathematical model; priority journal; simulation; statistical analysis; statistical model; algorithm; time factor; Algorithms; Computer Security; Genomics; Time Factors,,,,,"A federated ecosystem for sharing genomic, clinical data (2016) Science, 352 (6291), pp. 1278-1280. , GA4GH; Krol, A., (2015) Beacon Projects Cracks the Door for Genomic Data Sharing, , http://goo.gl/3fo1VU, Accessed 15 Aug 2016; Al Aziz, M.M., Hasan, M.Z., Mohammed, N., Alhadidi, D., Secure and efficient multiparty computation on genomic data (2016) Proceedings of the 20th International Database Engineering & Applications Symposium, , ACM Montreal; (2015) Privacy Risks in Genome Sharing Network, , http://goo.gl/rQqHkz, Accessed 19 Aug 2016; Shringarpure, S.S., Bustamante, C.D., Privacy risks from genomic data-sharing beacons (2015) Am J Hum Genet, 97 (5), pp. 631-646. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2MXhslGltbrE 26522470 4667107; Dyke, S.O., Dove, E.S., Knoppers, B.M., Sharing health-related data: A privacy test?

This approach is efficient (only a unidirectional transfer of PIN is needed) and simple (the sending device requires a vibration motor and receiving device requires an accelerometer). However, it has been shown to be susceptible to acoustic emanations usually produced by the vibration motor. Recent research introduced a mechanism to defeat these attacks by attempting to mask the acoustic leakage with deliberate acoustic noises. In this paper, we pursue a systematic investigation of the security of such a ""noisy vibrational pairing"" mechanism in a strong yet realistic adversarial model where the eavesdropper is co-located with the victim device(s). Our contributions are two-fold. First, we show that existing noisy vibrational pairing mechanisms - based on white noise as the masking signal - are vulnerable against a co-located eavesdropper (although they may defeat a distant eavesdropper). We build our attack based on standard signal processing and noise filtering techniques, and show that it can result in a complete compromise of pairing security. Second, we propose a defense that bolsters the masking signal with low-frequency audio tones. We present and address the challenges associated with producing such low-frequency sounds with current commodity hardware. We show that our defensive approach can not only resist our above attack but is also robust to more sophisticated, noise filtering and source separation methods when applicable. We also establish that the insertion of low-frequency sounds does not affect the receiving device's capability to sense the vibrations generated by the sending device. The suggested defense may therefore be used to enhance the security of noisy vibrational pairing without affecting its performance on a wide variety of devices. © 2017 ACM.",,Acoustic noise; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Signal processing; Source separation; Spurious signal noise; White noise; Wireless networks; Commodity hardware; Low-frequency sounds; Masking signals; Pairing mechanism; Recent researches; Separation methods; Standard signals; Vibration motor; Network security,,,,,"(2016) AmpAudio, , https://www.ampaudio.com, 4 2016; Anand, S., Saxena, N., Vibreaker: Securing vibrational pairing with deliberate acoustic noise (2016) 9th ACM Conference on Security & Privacy in Wireless and Mobile Networks (WiSec'16); Boyko, V., MacKenzie, P., Patel, S., Provably secure password-authenticated key exchange using diffie-hellman (2000) Eurocrypt; Cardoso, J., Blind source separations: Statistical principles (1998) Proc.

RIVALS will assist in developing network defense strategies through modeling adversarial network attack and defense dynamics. RIVALS will focus on peer-To-peer networks and use coevolutionary algorithms. In this contribution, we describe RIVALS' current suite of coevolutionary algorithms that use archiving to maintain progressive exploration and that support different solution concepts as fitness metrics. We compare and contrast their effectiveness by executing a standard coevolutionary benchmark (Compare-on-one) and RIVALS simulations on 3 different network topologies. Currently, we model denial of service (DOS) attack strategies by the attacker selecting one or more network servers to disable for some duration. Defenders can choose one of three different network routing protocols: shortest path, flooding and a peer-To-peer ring overlay to try to maintain their performance. Attack completion and resource cost minimization serve as attacker objectives. Mission completion and resource cost minimization are the reciprocal defender objectives. Our experiments show that existing algorithms either sacrifice execution speed or forgo the assurance of consistent results. rIPCA, our adaptation of a known coevolutionary algorithm named IPCA, is able to more consistently produce high quality results, albeit without IPCA's guarantees for results with monotonically increasing performance, without sacrificing.",Coevolution;

An autonomous maneuvering decision algorithm in an adversarial environment based on pilots tactics experience knowledge is proposed. Firstly, a situation assessment modeling method based on naive Bayes is addressed, in which the historical situation is took into consideration when predicting the next moment situation. Secondly, pilots' tactics experiences and the heuristic multi-UAVs cooperative attack strategy are mathematically modeled and brought in which can improve the decision operator efficiency. Finally, a decision method based on Nash equilibrium is described to work out sequences of optimal maneuvering at discrete time moment. Simulations results show that the algorithms quickly provide good feasible solutions, and find the optimal maneuvering solution in different typical air combat scenarios. © 2017 IEEE.",Air Combat; Heuristic Tactics Knowledge; Nash Equilibrium; UAV,,,,,,"Gertler, J., US unmanned aerial systems[C] (2012) Library of Congress Washington DC Congressional Research Service; Isaacs, R., (1951) Games of Pursuit [J]; Wang, X.G., Research on close air combat modeling of differential games for unmanned combat air vehicles [j] (2012) Acta Armamentarii, 10, pp. 1210-1216; Austin, F., Carbone, G., Falco, M., Automated maneuvering decisions for air-to-air combat [J] (1987) AIAA, pp. 87-2393; Guo, H., Zhou, D.Y., Zhang, K., Study on UCAV autonomous air combat maneuvering decision-making [j] (2010) Electronics Optics and Control, 8, pp. 28-32; Burgin, G.H., Sidor, L.B., Rule-based air combat simulation[R] (1988) Titan Systems Inclajolla; Sun, T.Z., Sun, J.B., Tactical decision-making for formation air combat based on hierarchical fuzzy petri net [j] (2011) Electronics, Optics and Control, 18 (11), pp. 22-26; Xuemei, H., Wei, Z., Chang, H., Autonomous maneuvering decision research of uav based on experience knowledge representation [c] (2016) Control and Decision Conference (2016 CCDC), the 28th Chinese, pp. 675-680. , IEEE; Digioia, G., Panzieri, S., INFUSION: A system for situation and threat assessment in current and foreseen scenarios[C] (2012) 2012 IEEE International Multi-Disciplinary Conference on Cognitive Methods in Situation Awareness and Decision Support (CogSIMA), pp. 316-323; McGrew, J.S., How, J.P., Williams, B., Air-combat strategy using ap-proximate dynamic programming [J] (2010) Journal of Guidance, Con-trol, and Dynamics, 33 (5), pp. 1641-1654",,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"29th Chinese Control and Decision Conference, CCDC 2017",28 May 2017 through 30 May 2017,,129162,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"Proc.

If an edge being attacked is not being defended the edge fails with a probability 0 < p < 1 (no-defense attack probability); if it is defended by only a single node it fails with probability q (single-defense attack probability), 0 ≤ q ≤ p; and, if it is defended by both the nodes the attack is successfully thwarted. We model the interaction between protecting nodes and the adversary as a game and study their equilibrium strategies. We note that in general the probability of an important link being defended by both of the nodes is higher compared to a less important link, such that a more important link fails with a lower probability. We also observe that the behavior of the adversary is radically different for the two different ranges of values of single-defense attack probability: 0 ≤ q ≤ p/2 and p/2 ≤ q ≤ p. We study the special scenarios of trees and connected communities and observe that in general the nodes will defend important links (such as cut edges) with high probability, while the adversary, in contrast to a centralized protection setting will attack less important links with a higher probability only in special scenarios. © 2017 IFIP.",,Network security; Adversarial environments; Centralized protections; Cut edge; Decentralized networks; Equilibrium strategy; High probability; Lower probabilities; Network protection; Probability,,,,,"Gambit: Software Tools for Game Theory; Aspnes, J., Chang, K., Yampolskiy, A., Inoculation strategies for victims of viruses and the sum-of-squares partition problem (2005) Proceedings of the Sixteenth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, SODA '05, pp. 43-52; Ciftcioglu, E.N., Pal, S., Chan, K.S., Cansever, D.H., Swami, A., Singh, A., Basu, P., Topology design under adversarial dynamics (2016) WiOpt, , May; Ciftcioglu, E.N., Pal, S., Chan, K.S., Cansever, D.H., Swami, A., Singh, A., Basu, P., Topology design games and dynamics in adversarial environments (2017) IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 35, pp. 628-642. , IEEE; Demaine, E.D., Zadimoghaddam, M., Minimizing the diameter of a network using shortcut edges (2010) Scandinavian Workshop on Algorithm Theory, pp. 420-431; Dijk, M.V., Juels, A., Oprea, A., Rivest, R.L., (2013) Flipit: The Game of Stealthy Takeover, 26, pp. 655-713. , Springer; Fabrikant, A., Luthra, A., Maneva, E., Papadimitriou, C.H., Shenker, S., On a network creation game (2003) Proceedings of Principles of Distributed Computing, PODC '03, pp. 347-351. , ACM; Fudenberg, D., Tirole, J., Game theory, 1991 (1991) Cambridge, Massachusetts, 393, p. 12; Goyal, S., Vigier, A., Attack, defence, and contagion in networks (2014) The Review of Economic Studies, 81 (4), pp. 1518-1542; Gueye, A., Walrand, J.C., Anantharam, V., Design of network topology in an adversarial environment (2010) Proceedings of the First International Conference on Decision and Game Theory for Security, GameSec'10, pp. 1-20. , Berlin, Heidelberg, Springer-Verlag; Kumar, V.S.A., Rajaraman, R., Sun, Z., Sundaram, R., Existence theorems and approximation algorithms for generalized network security games (2010) Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems, ICDCS '10, pp. 348-357; Laszka, A., Gueye, A., (2015) Network Topology Vulnerability/cost Trade-off: Model, Application, and Computational Complexity, 11, pp. 588-626. , Taylor & Francis; Laszka, A., Horvath, G., Felegyhazi, M., Buttyán, L., Flipthem: Modeling targeted attacks with flipit for multiple resources (2014) International Conference on Decision and Game Theory for Security, pp. 175-194. , Springer; Meyerson, A., Tagiku, B., Minimizing average shortest path distances via shortcut edge addition (2009) APPROX-RANDOM, Volume 5687 of LNCS, pp. 272-285. , Springer; Watanabe, T., Nakamura, A., Edge-connectivity augmentation problems (1987) Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 35 (1)","Pal, S.; Raytheon BBN TechnologiesUnited States; 电子邮件: siddharth.pal@raytheon.com",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2017 IFIP Networking Conference and Workshops, IFIP Networking 2017",12 June 2017 through 16 June 2017,,134347,,9.7839E+12,,,English,"IFIP Netw.

By adding to the input object an imperceptible amount of adversarial noise, it is highly likely that the classifier can be tricked into assigning the modified object to any desired class. It has also been observed that these adversarial samples generalize well across models. A complete understanding of the nature of adversarial samples has not yet emerged. Towards this goal, we present a novel theoretical result formally linking the adversarial vulnerability of learning to the intrinsic dimensionality of the data. In particular, our investigation establishes that as the local intrinsic dimensionality (LID) increases, 1-NN classifiers become increasingly prone to being subverted. We show that in expectation, a k-nearest neighbor of a test point can be transformed into its 1-nearest neighbor by adding an amount of noise that diminishes as the LID increases. We also provide an experimental validation of the impact of LID on adversarial perturbation for both synthetic and real data, and discuss the implications of our result for general classifiers. © 2017 IEEE.",,Nearest neighbor search; 1-nearest neighbor; Experimental validations; Intrinsic dimensionalities; K-nearest neighbors; Recent researches; State of the art; Synthetic and real data; Test points; Deep neural networks,,,,,"Lowd, D., Meek, C., Adversarial learning (2005) KDD; Szegedy, C., Zaremba, W., Sutskever, I., Bruna, J., Erhan, D., Goodfellow, I.J., Fergus, R., Intriguing properties of neural networks (2013) CoRR, , vol. abs/1312. 6199; Sabour, S., Cao, Y., Faghri, F., Fleet, D.J., Adversarial manipulation of deep representations (2015) CoRR, , vol. abs/1511. 05122; Goodfellow, I.J., Shlens, J., Szegedy, C., Explaining and harnessing adversarial examples (2014) CoRR, , vol. abs/1412. 6572; Houle, M.E., Dimensionality, discriminability, density & distance distributions (2013) ICDMW; Amsaleg, L., Chelly, O., Furon, T., Girard, S., Houle, M.E., Kawarabayashi, K., Nett, M., Estimating local intrinsic dimensionality (2015) KDD; Tabacof, P., Valle, E., Exploring the space of adversarial images (2015) CoRR, , vol. abs/1510. 05328; Cover, T., Hart, P., Nearest neighbor pattern classification (1967) IEEE TIT, 13 (1); Stone, C.J., Consistent parametric regression (1977) Annals of Statistics, 5 (4); Falconer, K., (2003) Fractal Geometry: Mathematical Foundations and Applications, , John Wiley & Sons; Grassberger, P., Procaccia, I., Measuring the strangeness of strange attractors (1983) Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena, 9 (1-2); Camastra, F., Vinciarelli, A., Estimating the intrinsic dimension of data with a fractal-based method (2002) IEEE TPAMI, 24 (10); Faloutsos, C., Kamel, I., Beyond uniformity and independence: Analysis of R-trees using the concept of fractal dimension (1994) PODS; Gupta, A., Krauthgamer, R., Lee, J.R., Bounded geometries, fractals, and low-distortion embeddings (2003) FOCS; Bruske, J., Sommer, G., Intrinsic dimensionality estimation with optimally topology preserving maps (1998) IEEE TPAMI, 20 (5); Fukunaga, K., Olsen, D.R., An algorithm for finding intrinsic dimensionality of data (1971) IEEE TOC, 20 (2); Pettis, E., Bailey, T., Jain, A., Dubes, R., An intrinsic dimensionality estimator from nearest-neighbor information (1979) IEEE TPAMI, 1; Rozza, A., Lombardi, G., Ceruti, C., Casiraghi, E., Campadelli, P., Novel high intrinsic dimensionality estimators (2012) Machine Learning, 89 (1-2); Verveer, P., Duin, R., An evaluation of intrinsic dimensionality estimators (1995) IEEE TPAMI, 17 (1); Karger, D.R., Ruhl, M., Finding nearest neighbors in growth-restricted metrics (2002) STOC; Houle, M.E., Kashima, H., Nett, M., Generalized expansion dimension (2012) ICDMW; Houle, M.E., Local intrinsic dimensionality I: An extreme-valuetheoretic formulation for similarity applications (2017) SISAP; Huisman, R., Koedijk, K.G., Kool, C.J.M., Palm, F., Tail-index estimates in small samples (2001) Journal of Business and Economic Statistics, 19 (2); Gomes, M.I., Canto Castro, L., Fraga Alves, M.I., Pestana, D., Statistics of extremes for IID data and breakthroughs in the estimation of the extreme value index: Laurens de Haan leading contributions (2008) Extremes, 11; Jégou, H., Tavenard, R., Douze, M., Amsaleg, L., Searching in one billion vectors: Re-rank with source coding (2011) ICASSP","Amsaleg, L.; CNRS-IRISAFrance",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2017 IEEE Workshop on Information Forensics and Security, WIFS 2017",4 December 2017 through 7 December 2017,,134376,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Workshop Inf.

In this paper, we focus on one of the important type of data dependency constraints, the functional dependency (FD) and study the security threats by the adversarial FDs.

In machine learning process, the test set and the training set usually have the same probability distribution and through the information of learning the training set, the malicious samples in the machine learning algorithm can usually be correctly classified. However, the classification algorithm has neglected the classification under adversarial environment, so instead they will modify the features of test data in order to spoof the classifier so as to escape its detection. In this paper, we will consider to modify the feature value of the test samples in accordance with attack algorithm proposed by Battista Biggio and further improve the algorithm. As each feature has a range of independent constraints, so the algorithm should be transformed into a constrained optimization problem. This is done in order to make the original sample modify the smaller distance so as to escape the detection of the classifier, while also improve the convergence rate during the generation of adversarial samples. © 2017 IEEE.",adversarial machine learning; component; constrained optimization; evasion attacks,Constrained optimization; Intelligent systems; Intrusion detection; Knowledge engineering; Learning algorithms; Probability distributions; Adversarial environments; Classification algorithm; component; Constrained optimi-zation problems; Convergence rates; evasion attacks; Network intrusion detection; Optimization strategy; Machine learning,,,,,"Dalvi, N., Domingos, P., Mausam, Adversarial classification (2004) Proceeding of the 2004 ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 99-108. , ACM Press; Lowd, D., Meek, C., Adversarial learning (2005) Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 641-647. , ACM Press; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Can machine learning be secure?

The exploration of publicly available data has been used to predict events in the socio-political domain, but the adversarial and covert behavior of actors in cyber security creates additional challenges. This paper describes a framework for Information Foraging for Algorithm Discovery (IFAD) that addresses standard data-science issues of volume and variety, by balancing human intuition with automation, and thus taking initial steps toward supporting the increasing need for rapid analysis of, and tool development for, big data. Our results demonstrate that cognitive augmentation, and information foraging in particular, is useful in the development of tools to anticipate cyber attacks using publicly available data. © 2017 IEEE.",anticipatory intelligence; cyber security; information foraging; predictions; threat intelligence,Big data; Crime; Forecasting; Network security; anticipatory intelligence; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Information foraging; Rapid analysis; threat intelligence; Tool development; Computer crime,,,,,"Okutan, A., Yang, S.J., McConky, K., Predicting cyber attacks with Bayesian networks using unconventional signals (2017) Proceedings of the 12th Annual Conference on Cyber and Information Security Research, p. 13. , ACM; Manyika, J., Chui, M., Brown, B., Bughin, J., Dobbs, R., Roxburgh, C., Byers, A.H., (2011) Big Data: The Next Frontier for Innovation, Competition, and Productivity, , McKinsey Global Institute, Tech.

Due to the large amount of generated data over the network, its storage for further analysis may not be feasible. Moreover, current attacks are becoming more sophisticated, as the attackers are attempting to evade traditional intrusion detection mechanisms by perverting their properties. This paper presents a novel real-time (ongoing) network traffic measurement approach that supports resilient analysis for stream learning intrusion detection. The network data is grouped at runtime according to its characteristics, while each network traffic flow is discretized at regular time intervals. Each network flow is classified by a multi-view stream learning classifiers pool, defining the network flow class through a majority voting approach. The proposal is able to provide resiliency to the classifiers even for the detection of unknown attacks. The evaluation tests for the average operation point (25 views) provides an increase in the system resilience to adversarial attacks of 22 % when compared to traditional approaches. Moreover, in the scalability experiments with a 10-node (single core each) cluster testbed, the network flow measurement solution (1 view) reached 1.38 Gbps throughput, while the proposed resilient stream learning intrusion detection with 25 views reached a throughput of 1.19 Gbps. © 2017 IEEE.",,Digital storage; Flow measurement; Learning classifiers; Network traffic flow; Network traffic measurement; Networked systems; Real time analysis; System resiliences; Traditional approaches; Voting approach; Intrusion detection,,,,,"http://www.cisco.com, Cisco VNI Forecast and Methodology, 2015-2020/, [Accessed: September 2017]; Zuech, R., Khoshgoftaar, T.M., Wald, R., Intrusion detection and Big Heterogeneous Data: A Survey (2015) J.

The devices in the overlay network are required to provide coverage to the underlay devices as well as to remain connected to other overlay devices. The coordination, planning, and design of such two-layer heterogeneous networks is an important problem to address. Moreover, the mobility of the nodes and their vulnerability to adversaries pose new challenges to the connectivity. For instance, the connectivity of devices can be affected by changes in the network, e.g., the mobility of the underlay devices or the unavailability of overlay devices due to failure or adversarial attacks. To this end, this work proposes a feedback based adaptive, self-configurable, and resilient framework for the overlay network that cognitively adapts to the changes in the network to provide reliable connectivity between spatially dispersed smart devices. Our results show that if sufficient overlay devices are available, the framework leads to a connected configuration that ensures a high coverage of the mobile underlay network. Moreover, the framework can actively reconfigure itself in the event of varying levels of device failure. © 2017 IEEE.",Connectivity; Internet of things; resilience; unmanned aerial vehicles,Heterogeneous networks; Internet of things; Network architecture; Overlay networks; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Communication infrastructure; Connectivity; Device failures; Feed-back based; Mobile Internet; resilience; Self-configurable; Underlay networks; Network layers,,,,,"Stankovic, J.A., Research directions for the internet of things (2014) IEEE Internet Things J., 1 (1). , Feb; Sanctis, M.D., Cianca, E., Araniti, G., Bisio, I., Prasad, R., Satellite communications supporting internet of remote things (2016) IEEE Internet Things J., 3 (1). , Feb; Tanha, M., Sajjadi, D., Tong, F., Pan, J., Disaster management and response for modern cellular networks using flow-based multi-hop device-to-device communications (2016) IEEE 84th Veh.

However, in hostile networks where the storage nodes may be compromised, the storage capacity of the network can be significantly affected. In this paper, we propose two optimal regenerating code constructions through rate-matching to combat this kind of adversarial attacks in hostile networks. We first develop a two-layer rate-matched regenerating code construction. By matching the parameters of the full rate code and the partial rate code, we can optimize the overall storage efficiency while maintaining the corrupted node detection probability. Through comprehensive analysis, we show that the two-layer rate-matched regenerating code can achieve 70% higher storage efficiency than the universally resilient regenerating code. We then propose an optimal m-layer regenerating code construction. While the principle remains the same as the two-layer code, it is designed to optimize the total number of detectable corrupted nodes of m layers from which the errors can be corrected under the constraint of any given code efficiency. Compared with the universally resilient regenerating code with the same rate, our m-layer code can detect 50% more corrupted nodes. © 2017 IEEE.",Adversary attack; Errorcorrection; MDS code; Optimal regenerating code,Bandwidth; Codes (symbols); Digital storage; Efficiency; Error correction; Adversary attack; Comprehensive analysis; Distributed storage; MDS code; Optimal construction; Regenerating codes; Storage capacity; Storage efficiency; Optimal systems,,,,,"Dimakis, A.G., Godfrey, P.B., Wu, Y., Wainwright, M.J., Ramchandran, K., Network coding for distributed storage systems (2010) IEEE Trans.

The control input stream is compromised by an attacker who modifies the (cyber) control signals transmitted with the objective of increasing the quadratic cost incurred by the (physical) controller whilst maintaining a degree of stealthiness. The tradeoff between the increase in quadratic cost and the stealthiness (or detectability), are measured by the Kullback-Leibler distance between legitimate and falsified state dynamics is characterized analytically. It is shown that the optimal adversarial strategy is a sequence of independent Gaussian noise signals with carefully chosen variances whose eigenvalues align with those of the legitimate noise covariance with the scaling reflecting the desired quadratic cost increase. As the stealthiness decreases, the optimal tradeoff is shown to be linear with slope inversely proportional to the maximal of maximal eigenvalue of modified reward matrices. Numerical simulations are presented that showcase the optimal tradeoff and the comparison of the legitimate and falsified dynamics under different requirements on detectability. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",Cyber-physical systems; data models; Kalman filters; linear feedback control systems; Markov processes; privacy; security; system dynamics,Adaptive control systems; Control systems; Costs; Cyber Physical System; Data privacy; Data structures; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Embedded systems; Feedback control; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Kalman filters; Markov processes; False data injection; Kullback-Leibler distance; Linear feedback control systems; Linear quadratic Gaussian; Linear quadratic Gaussian control; Physical control systems; security; System Dynamics; Robustness (control systems),,,,,"Kosut, O., Jia, L., Thomas, R.J., Tong, L., Malicious data attacks on smart grid state estimation: Attack strategies and countermeasures (2010) Proc. 1st IEEE Int.

Resonant acoustic injection attacks are already known to cause malfunctions by disabling MEMS-based gyroscopes. However, an open question remains on how to move beyond denial of service attacks to achieve full adversarial control of sensor outputs. Our work investigates how analog acoustic injection attacks can damage the digital integrity of a popular type of sensor: the capacitive MEMS accelerometer. Spoofing such sensors with intentional acoustic interference enables an out-of-spec pathway for attackers to deliver chosen digital values to microprocessors and embedded systems that blindly trust the unvalidated integrity of sensor outputs. Our contributions include (1) modeling the physics of malicious acoustic interference on MEMS accelerometers, (2) discovering the circuit-level security flaws that cause the vulnerabilities by measuring acoustic injection attacks on MEMS accelerometers as well as systems that employ on these sensors, and (3) two software-only defenses that mitigate many of the risks to the integrity of MEMS accelerometer outputs. We characterize two classes of acoustic injection attacks with increasing levels of adversarial control: output biasing and output control. We test these attacks against 20 models of capacitive MEMS accelerometers from 5 different manufacturers. Our experiments find that 75% are vulnerable to output biasing, and 65% are vulnerable to output control. To illustrate end-to-end implications, we show how to inject fake steps into a Fitbit with a $5 speaker. In our self-stimulating attack, we play a malicious music file from a smartphone's speaker to control the on-board MEMS accelerometer trusted by a local app to pilot a toy RC car. In addition to offering hardware design suggestions to eliminate the root causes of insecure amplification and filtering, we introduce two lowcost software defenses that mitigate output biasing attacks: randomized sampling and 180° out-of-phase sampling. These software-only approaches mitigate attacks by exploiting the periodic and predictable nature of the malicious acoustic interference signal. Our results call into question the wisdom of allowing microprocessors and embedded systems to blindly trust that hardware abstractions alone will ensure the integrity of sensor outputs. © 2017 IEEE.",acoustics; analog cybersecurity; analog sensors; attacks and defenses; embedded systems security; microelectromechanical systems,Accelerometers; Acoustics; Automobile manufacture; Capacitive sensors; Denial-of-service attack; Electromechanical devices; Hardware; MEMS; Network security; Analog sensors; attacks and defenses; Cyber security; Embedded systems securities; Hardware abstractions; Interference signal; MEMS based gyroscopes; Randomized sampling; Embedded systems,,,,,"Zhao, N., Full-featured pedometer design realized with 3-axis digital accelerometer (2010) Analog Dialogue; Wright, A., Pratt, T., (2008) Dell Raises the Bar in Shock-resistant Hard Drives, , http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/vectors/2008freefallprotection.pdf, Dell Inc., Tech.

The objective of the HAP is to use the learned estimate in order to determine the transmission power of the energy signal to be supplied to its associated device. However, such a learning scheme is subject to attacks by an adversary who tries to alter the HAP's learned estimate of the transmission power distribution in order to minimize the HAP's supplied energy. To build a robust estimate against such attacks, an unsupervised Bayesian learning method is proposed allowing the HAP to perform its estimation based only on the advertised transmisson power computed in each time slot. The proposed robust learning method relies on the assumption that the device's true transmission power is greater than or equal to advertised value. Then, based on the robust estimate, the problem of power selection of the energy signal by the HAP is formulated. The HAP optimal power selection problem is shown to be a discrete convex optimization problem, and a closed-form solution of the HAP's optimal transmission power is obtained. The results show that the proposed robust Bayesian learning scheme yields significant performance gains, by reducing the percentage of dropped transmitter's packets of about 85% compared to a conventional Bayesian learning approach. The results also show that these performance gains are achieved without jeopardizing the energy consumption of the HAP. © 2017 IFIP.",,Bayesian networks; Convex optimization; Energy harvesting; Energy utilization; Learning systems; Mobile ad hoc networks; Optimization; Transmitters; Wireless ad hoc networks; Wireless networks; Adversarial learning; Bayesian learning scheme; Closed form solutions; Convex optimization problems; Optimal transmission; Unsupervised Bayesian learning; Wireless rf energy harvesting; Wireless transmitter; Education,,,,,"Atzoria, L., Ierab, A., Morabitoc, G., The Internet of Things: A survey (2010) Computer Networks, 54 (15), pp. 2787-2805; Lu, W.P., Niyato, D., Kim, D.I., Han, Z., Wireless networks with RF Energy Harvesting: A Contemporary Survey (2015) IEEE Communications Tutorials and Surveys, 17 (2), pp. 757-789; Kang, X., Ho, C.K., Sun, S., Full-duplex wireless-powered communication network with energy causality (2015) IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, 14 (10), pp. 5539-5551. , Oct; Hadzi-Velkov, Z., Nikoloska, I., Chingoska, H., Zlatanov, N., Proportional fair scheduling in wireless networks with rf energy harvesting and processing cost (2016) IEEE Communications Letters, 20 (10), pp. 2107-2110. , Oct; Chen, H., Ma, Y., Lin, Z., Li, Y., Vucetic, B., Distributed power control in interference channels with qos constraints and rf energy harvesting: A game-theoretic approach (2016) IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 65 (12), pp. 10063-10069. , Dec; Hu, F., Hao, Q., Intelligent sensor networks: The integration of sensor networks (2012) Signal Processing and Machine Learning, , CRC Press; Park, T., Abuzainab, N., Saad, W., Learning how to communicate in the internet of things: Finite resources and heterogeneity (2016) IEEE Access, 4, pp. 7063-7073. , Nov; Azmat, F., Chen, Y., Stocks, N., Predictive modelling of rf energy for wireless powered communications (2016) IEEE Communications Letters, 20 (1), pp. 173-176. , Jan; Zou, Z., Gidmark, A., Charalambous, T., Johansson, M., Optimal radio frequency energy harvesting with limited energy arrival knowledge (2016) IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, , Aug; Gregori, M., Gómez-Vilardebò, J., Online learning algorithms for wireless energy harvesting nodes (2016) Proc. of 2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), pp. 1-6. , Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Insecurity in the internet of things (white paper) (2017) Symantic, p. 6. , Mar. 2015, retrieved Jan; Niyato, D., Wang, P., Kim, D.I., Han, Z., Xiao, L., Game theoretic modeling of jamming attack in wireless powered communication networks (2015) Proc. of IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), pp. 6018-6023. , London, Jun; Niyato, D., Wang, P., Kim, D.I., Han, Z., Xiao, L., Performance analysis of delay-constrained wireless energy harvesting communication networks under jamming attacks (2015) Proc. of IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC), pp. 1823-1828. , New Orleans, LA, USA, Jun; El Shafie, A., Niyato, D., Al-Dhahir, N., Security of rechargeable energy-harvesting transmitters in wireless networks (2016) IEEE Wireless Communications Letters, 5 (4), pp. 384-387. , Aug; Salem, A., Hamdi, K.A., Rabie, K.M., Physical layer security with rf energy harvesting in af multi-antenna relaying networks (2016) IEEE Transactions on Communications, 64 (7), pp. 3025-3038. , Jul; Wang Ng, B.K., Tian, G.L., Tang, M.L., (2011) Dirichlet and Related Distributions: Theory, Methods and Applications, , John Wiley & Sons; Chen, Z., Guo, S., Zheng, K., Yang, Y., Modeling of man-in-the-middle attack in the wireless networks (2007) Proc. of International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing, pp. 2255-2258. , Shanghai, China, Sep; Paulino, C., Pereira, C., Bayesian methods for categorical data under informative general censoring (1995) Biometrika, 82 (2), pp. 439-446. , Jun; Dickey, J.M., Jiang, J., Kadane, J.B., Bayesian methods for censored categorical data (1987) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 82 (399), pp. 773-781. , Sep; Chen, Y.L., Han, Z., Vucetic, B., A stackelberg game-based energy trading scheme for power beacon-assisted wireless-powered communication (2015) Proc. of IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 3177-3181. , South Brisbane, QLD, Australia, Apr; Lin, F.Y., Hsiao, C., Yen, H., Hsieh, Y., A near-optimal distributed qos constrained routing algorithm for multichannel wireless sensor networks (2013) Sensors, 13 (12). , Dec",,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"15th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks, WiOpt 2017",15 May 2017 through 19 May 2017,,128704,,9.7839E+12,,,English,"Int.

Unfortunately, neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples: given an input x and any target classification t, it is possible to find a new input x' that is similar to x but classified as t. This makes it difficult to apply neural networks in security-critical areas. Defensive distillation is a recently proposed approach that can take an arbitrary neural network, and increase its robustness, reducing the success rate of current attacks' ability to find adversarial examples from 95% to 0.5%.In this paper, we demonstrate that defensive distillation does not significantly increase the robustness of neural networks by introducing three new attack algorithms that are successful on both distilled and undistilled neural networks with 100% probability. Our attacks are tailored to three distance metrics used previously in the literature, and when compared to previous adversarial example generation algorithms, our attacks are often much more effective (and never worse). Furthermore, we propose using high-confidence adversarial examples in a simple transferability test we show can also be used to break defensive distillation. We hope our attacks will be used as a benchmark in future defense attempts to create neural networks that resist adversarial examples. © 2017 IEEE.",,Distillation; Distance metrics; Generation algorithm; High confidence; Security-critical; State of the art; Target Classification; Network security,,,,,"Andor, D., Alberti, C., Weiss, D., Severyn, A., Presta, A., Ganchev, K., Petrov, S., Collins, M., (2016) Globally Normalized Transition-based Neural Networks, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1603. 06042; Bastani, O., Ioannou, Y., Lampropoulos, L., Vytiniotis, D., Nori, A., Criminisi, A., (2016) Measuring Neural Net Robustness with Constraints, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1605. 07262; Bojarski, M., Del Testa, D., Dworakowski, D., Firner, B., Flepp, B., Goyal, P., Jackel, L.D., Zhang, J., (2016) End to End Learning for Self-driving Cars, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1604. 07316; Bourzac, K., (2016) Bringing Big Neural Networks to Self-driving Cars, Smartphones, and Drones, , http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/embedded-systems/bringing-big-neural-networks-to-selfdriving-cars-smartphones-and-drones; Carlini, N., Mishra, P., Vaidya, T., Zhang, Y., Sherr, M., Shields, C., Wagner, D., Zhou, W., Hidden voice commands (2016) 25th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 16), , Austin, TX; Chandola, V., Banerjee, A., Kumar, V., Anomaly detection: A survey (2009) ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 41 (3), p. 15; Clevert, D.-A., Unterthiner, T., Hochreiter, S., (2015) Fast and Accurate Deep Network Learning by Exponential Linear Units (ELUs), , arXiv preprint arXiv:1511. 07289; Dahl, G.E., Stokes, J.W., Deng, L., Large-scale malware classification using random projections and neural networks (2013) 2013 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, pp. 3422-3426. , IEEE; Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L., Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database (2009) Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009.

We focus on the basic membership inference attack: given a data record and black-box access to a model, determine if the record was in the model's training dataset. To perform membership inference against a target model, we make adversarial use of machine learning and train our own inference model to recognize differences in the target model's predictions on the inputs that it trained on versus the inputs that it did not train on. We empirically evaluate our inference techniques on classification models trained by commercial 'machine learning as a service' providers such as Google and Amazon. Using realistic datasets and classification tasks, including a hospital discharge dataset whose membership is sensitive from the privacy perspective, we show that these models can be vulnerable to membership inference attacks. We then investigate the factors that influence this leakage and evaluate mitigation strategies. © 2017 IEEE.",,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Learning systems; Classification models; Classification tasks; Hospital discharge; Inference attacks; Inference techniques; Machine learning models; Mitigation strategy; Training dataset; Education,,,,,"Abadi, M., Chu, A., Goodfellow, I., McMahan, H.B., Mironov, I., Talwar, K., Zhang, L., Deep learning with differential privacy (2016) CCS; Ateniese, G., Mancini, L.V., Spognardi, A., Villani, A., Vitali, D., Felici, G., Hacking smart machines with smarter ones: How to extract meaningful data from machine learning classifiers (2015) International Journal of Security and Networks, 10 (3), pp. 137-150; Backes, M., Berrang, P., Humbert, M., Manoharan, P., Membership privacy in MicroRNA-based studies (2016) CCS; Barni, M., Failla, P., Lazzeretti, R., Sadeghi, A., Schneider, T., Privacypreserving ECG classification with branching programs and neural networks (2011) Trans.

In practice, this threat is addressed by adhering to a constant-time programming discipline, which imposes strict constraints on the way in which programs are written. This introduces an additional hurdle for programmers faced with the already difficult task of writing secure code, highlighting the need for solutions that give the same source-level guarantees while supporting more natural programming models. We propose a novel type system for verifying that programs correctly implement constant-resource behavior. Our type system extends recent work on automatic amortized resource analysis (AARA), a set of techniques that automatically derive provable upper bounds on the resource consumption of programs. We devise new techniques that build on the potential method to achieve compositionality, precision, and automation. A strict global requirement that a program always maintains constant resource usage is too restrictive for most practical applications. It is sufficient to require that the program's resource behavior remain constant with respect to an attacker who is only allowed to observe part of the program's state and behavior. To account for this, our type system incorporates information flow tracking into its resource analysis. This allows our system to certify programs that need to violate the constant-time requirement in certain cases, as long as doing so does not leak confidential information to attackers. We formalize this guarantee by defining a new notion of resource-aware noninterference, and prove that our system enforces it. Finally, we show how our type inference algorithm can be used to synthesize a constant-time implementation from one that cannot be verified as secure, effectively repairing insecure programs automatically. We also show how a second novel AARA system that computes lower bounds on resource usage can be used to derive quantitative bounds on the amount of information that a program leaks through its resource use. We implemented each of these systems in Resource Aware ML, and show that it can be applied to verify constant-time behavior in a number of applicationsincluding encryption and decryption routines, database queries, and other resource-aware functionality. © 2017 IEEE.",Information flow; Language-based security; Resource analysis; Static analysis; Timing channels,Application programs; Cryptography; Inference engines; Query languages; Side channel attack; Confidential information; Encryption and decryption; Information flow tracking; Information flows; Language-based security; Resource analysis; Timing channels; Type Inference Algorithm; Static analysis,,,,,"Kocher, P.C., Timing attacks on implementations of diffie-hellman, RSA, DSS, and other systems (1996) 16th Annual International Cryptology Conference (CRYPTO'96); Reiter, M.K., Side channels in multi-tenant environments (2015) Proceedings of the 2015 ACM Workshop on Cloud Computing Security Workshop; Ristenpart, T., Tromer, E., Shacham, H., Savage, S., Hey, you, get off of my cloud: Exploring information leakage in third-party compute clouds (2009) Proceedings of the 16th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security; Brumley, D., Boneh, D., Remote timing attacks are practical (2003) Proceedings of the 12th Annual USENIX Security Symposium, , (Berkeley, CA, USA), USENIX Association; Canvel, B., Hiltgen, A., Vaudenay, S., Vuagnoux, M., (2003) Password Interception in A SSL/TLS Channel; AlFardan, N.J., Paterson, K.G., Lucky thirteen: Breaking the TLS and DTLS record protocols (2013) 2013 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy; Gullasch, D., Bangerter, E., Krenn, S., Cache games-bringing access-based cache attacks on aes to practice (2011) Proceedings of the 2011 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy; Haeberlen, A., Pierce, B.C., Narayan, A., Differential privacy under fire (2011) Proceedings of the 20th Annual USENIX Security Symposium; Andrysco, M., Kohlbrenner, D., Mowery, K., Jhala, R., Lerner, S., Shacham, H., On subnormal floating point and abnormal timing (2015) 2015 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy; Felten, E.W., Schneider, M.A., Timing attacks on web privacy (2000) Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security; Bortz, A., Boneh, D., Exposing private information by timing web applications (2007) Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on World Wide Web; Zhang, Y., Juels, A., Reiter, M.K., Ristenpart, T., Crosstenant side-channel attacks in paas clouds (2014) Proceedings of the 2014 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security; Almeida, J.C.B., Barbosa, M., Barthe, G., Dupressoir, F., Emmi, M., Verifying constant-time implementations (2016) 25th USENIX Security Symposium, , (Austin, TX), Aug; Rodrigues, B., Quintão Pereira, F.M., Aranha, D.F., Sparse representation of implicit flows with applications to side-channel detection (2016) Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Compiler Construction; Barthe, G., Betarte, G., Campo, J., Luna, C., Pichardie, D., System-level non-interference for constant-time cryptography (2014) Proceedings of the 2014 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security; Molnar, D., Piotrowski, M., Schultz, D., Wagner, D., The program counter security model: Automatic detection and removal of control-flow side channel attacks (2006) Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Information Security and Cryptology; Askarov, A., Zhang, D., Myers, A.C., Predictive black-box mitigation of timing channels (2010) Proceedings of the 17th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security; Köpf, B., Dürmuth, M., A provably secure and efficient countermeasure against timing attacks (2009) Proceedings of the 22nd Annual IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symposium, , July; Hofmann, M., Jost, S., Static prediction of heap space usage for first-order functional programs (2003) 30th ACM Symp. on Principles of Prog.

However, recent works have shown that it is quite easy to create adversarial examples, i.e., images intentionally created or modified to cause the deep neural network to make a mistake. They are like optical illusions for machines containing changes unnoticeable to the human eye. This represents a serious threat for machine learning methods. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of the representations learned by the fooled neural network, analyzing the activations of its hidden layers. Specifically, we tested scoring approaches used for kNN classification, in order to distinguishing between correctly classified authentic images and adversarial examples. The results show that hidden layers activations can be used to detect incorrect classifications caused by adversarial attacks. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Adversarial images detection; Deep Convolutional Neural Network; Machine Learning Security,Artificial intelligence; Chemical activation; Deep learning; Image classification; Indexing (of information); Learning systems; Neural networks; Computer vision applications; Convolutional neural network; Hidden layers; Human eye; K-NN classifications; Machine learning methods; Optical illusions; State of the art; Deep neural networks,,,,,"Amato, G., Carrara, F., Falchi, F., Gennaro, C., Meghini, C., Vairo, C., Deep learning for decentralized parking lot occupancy detection (2017) Expert Systems with Applications, 72 (2017), pp. 327-334; Amato, G., Falchi, F., Gennaro, C., Rabitti, F., YFCC100M-HNfc6: A large-scale deep features benchmark for similarity search (2016) International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications, pp. 196-209. , Springer; Amato, G., Falchi, F., Vadicamo, L., Visual recognition of ancient inscriptions using convolutional neural network and fisher vector (2016) Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage (JOCCH), 9 (4), p. 21. , (2016); Baraldi, L., Grana, C., Cucchiara, R., (2016) Hierarchical Boundary-Aware Neural Encoder for Video Captioning, , arXiv preprint arXiv: 1611.09312 (2016); Bayar, B., Stamm, M.C., A deep learning approach to universal image manipulation detection using a new convolutional layer (2016) 4th ACM Workshop on Information Hiding and Multimedia Security, pp. 5-10; Bengio, Y., Courville, A., Vincent, P., Representation learning: A review and new perspectives (2013) IEEE Trans.

In this paper, we explore adversarial attacks that reduce the size of spectrum holes by showing their advantage compared to a random jammer. Using a game-theoretical approach, we design an optimal scanning strategy that provides an increased probability of detecting such an attack. The advantage of our strategy is achieved by focusing scanning efforts on bands that are more likely to be attacked, and neglecting the others. However, such focused scanning is a disadvantage since, if the adversary has a different objective, he can safely sneak usage of the bands neglected by such a specially-tuned spectrum scanner. To deal with this problem, we also derive the optimal scanning allocation that balances between applying the anti-spectrum holes attack scanning strategy and scanning the neglected bands so as to prevent the possibility of the adversary using those bands without being detected. © 2017 IEEE.",game theory; jamming; spectrum holes; Spectrum scanning,,,,,,"Fragkiadakis, A.G., Tragos, E.Z., Askoxylakis, I.G., A survey on security threats and detection techniques in cognitive radio networks (2013) IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 15, pp. 428-445; Marinho, J., Granjal, J., Monteiro, E., A survey on security attacks and countermeasures with primary user detection in cognitive radio networks (2015) EURASIP Journal on Information Security, 4, pp. 1-14; Manshaei, M.H., Zhu, Q., Alpcan, T., Basar, T., Hubaux, J.-P., Game theory meets network security and privacy (2013) ACM Computing Survey, 45 (3); Chen, L., Leneutreb, J., Fight jamming with jamming - A game theoretic analysis of jamming attack in wireless networks and defense strategy (2011) Computer Networks, 55, pp. 2259-2270; Garnaev, A., Trappe, W., One-time spectrum coexistence in dynamic spectrum access when the secondary user May be Malicious (2015) IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 10, pp. 1064-1075; Xiao, L., Liu, J., Li, Q., Mandayam, N.B., Poor, H.V., User-centric view of jamming games in cognitive radio networks (2015) IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 10, pp. 2578-2590; El-Bardan, R., Brahma, S., Varshney, P.K., Power control with jammer location uncertainty: A game theoretic perspective (2014) Proc. 48th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS), pp. 1-6; Garnaev, A., Baykal-Gursoy, M., Poor, H.V., Incorporating attack-type uncertainty into network protection (2014) IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 9, pp. 1278-1287; Garnaev, A., Trappe, W., Kung, C.-T., Optimizing scanning strategies: Selecting scanning bandwidth in adversarial RF environments (2013) Proc. the 8th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks (CROWNCOM), pp. 148-153; Firouzbakht, K., Noubir, G., Salehi, M., On the performance of adaptive packetized wireless communication links under jamming (2014) IEEE Trans. on Wireless Communications, 13, pp. 3481-3495; Garnaev, A., Trappe, W., Kung, C.-T., Dependence of optimal monitoring strategy on the application to be protected (2012) Proc.

Typically, it is costly and time consuming to build a classifier, because this requires collecting training data (e.g., through crowdsourcing), selecting a suitable machine learning algorithm (through extensive tests and using domain-specific knowledge), and optimizing the underlying hyperparameters (applying a good understanding of the classifier's structure). In addition, all this information is typically proprietary and should be protected. With the proposed black-box attack approach, an adversary can use deep learning to reliably infer the necessary information by using labels previously obtained from the classifier under attack, and build a functionally equivalent machine learning classifier without knowing the type, structure or underlying parameters of the original classifier. Results for a text classification application demonstrate that deep learning can infer Naive Bayes and SVM classifiers with high accuracy and steal their functionalities. This new attack paradigm with deep learning introduces additional security challenges for online machine learning algorithms and raises the need for novel mitigation strategies to counteract the high fidelity inference capability of deep learning. © 2017 IEEE.",Adversarial machine learning; Classifier; Deep learning; Exploratory attacks; Machine learning,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Classifiers; Education; Inference engines; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; National security; Security systems; Text processing; Domain-specific knowledge; Exploratory attacks; Hyperparameters; Mitigation strategy; Online machines; Security challenges; SVM classifiers; Text classification; Deep learning,,,,,"Huang, L., Joseph, A., Nelson, B., Rubinstein, B., Tygar, J., Adversarial machine learning (2011) Proc.

Authentication, in particular, requires the PUF to produce a very large number of challenge-response-pairs (CRPs) and, of even greater importance, requires the PUF to be resistant to adversarial attacks that attempt to model and clone the PUF (model-building attacks). Entropy is critically important to the model-building resistance of the PUF. A variety of metrics have been proposed for reporting Entropy, each measuring the randomness of information embedded within PUF-generated bitstrings. In this paper, we report the Entropy, MinEntropy, conditional MinEntropy, Interchip hamming distance and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) statistical test results using bitstrings generated by a Hardware-Embedded Delay PUF called HELP. The bitstrings are generated from data collected in hardware experiments on 500 copies of HELP implemented on a set of Xilinx Zynq 7020 SoC Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) subjected to industrial-level temperature and voltage conditions. Special test cases are constructed which purposely create worst case correlations for bitstring generation. Our results show that the processes proposed within HELP to generate bitstrings add significantly to their Entropy, and show that classical re-use of PUF components, e.g., path delays, does not result in large Entropy losses commonly reported for other PUF architectures. © 2017 by the authors.

In adversarial environments, the security becomes a crucial issue in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). There are various security services in WSNs such as key management, authentication, and pairwise key establishment. Due to some limitations on sensor nodes, the previous key establishment techniques are unsuitable for WSNs. To overcome these problems, researchers propose several key pre-distribution schemes. Our proposed approach uses a combinatorial framework in the hypercube-based (HB) scheme to pre-distribute keys to each sensor node. By this way, the number of common keys between two nodes in a wireless communication range increases. Therefore, the level of security in terms of resilience against node capture attack and the probability of re-establishing an indirect key will be improved.",Balanced incomplete block design (BIBD); Dynamic key path discovery algorithm; Hypercube; Key pre-distribution; Wireless sensor network,,,,,,"Anzani, M., Haj Seyyed Javadi, H., Modiri, V., Keymanagement scheme for wireless sensor networks based on merging blocks of symmetric design (2017) Wirel.

These special methods are designed to provide the necessary security and privacy privileges to the registered users of the biometric system. Similar to other security domains, these schemes require to follow certain properties or characteristics like unlinkability, irreversibility and low information leakage from the stored data. Ideally, these schemes must not result in any degradation of the biometric recognition performance as a whole. Designing a system which balances all these factors efficiently has been a major challenge. Contemporary frameworks generally relax one or more of these parameters in order to achieve their application specific goals. However recently, a modified Bloom filter based scheme was proposed which apparently provided competent security measures in addition to high recognition accuracy rates. However subsequent studies refuted the security guarantees of the scheme by providing adversarial attacks with practical bounds. In our work, we address this issue and propose a modified Bloom filter based framework which provides all the desirable security measures of a biometric template protection scheme. Not only have we theoretically proved all the security notions of our model, but also experimentally verified our claims. Thus our proposed design provides satisfactory security guarantees in addition to the implicit advantages of using Bloom filters like speed and efficiency. Finally, there is no reduction in the performance rates of the underlying system since we perform the matching of the biometric traits in their original forms (in contrast to some transformed space). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Biometrics;

In this type of attack, an adversary intelligently captures the node(s) and extracts the cryptographic information to destroy the privacy, safety and reliability of the network. We propose a novel hybrid approach for constructing the path vulnerability matrix that maximizes the attacking efficiency and lowers the resource expenditure of the adversary. The main strength of the proposed matrix lies in incorporating various criteria such as the type of application running on the nodes, capturing cost, key dominance ranking, articulation point and intersecting shortest path nodes in estimating the vulnerability. The location of the data sink is considered as a major factor in estimating the vulnerability of the nodes in the network. The proposed matrix is compared with existing attacking strategies in terms of the number of attacking rounds, energy cost and fraction of compromised traffic. Although in this paper, we have considered adversarial point of view but the proposed matrix can be extended for the defender application also. The path vulnerability matrix provides vulnerability estimation that can be used to analyze system security weakness and helps to defend against them effectively and efficiently. The performance of proposed approach has been validated with respect to average path compromise ratio, average routing path length and average route successful ratio. We have also introduced an attack resistant random key predistribution scheme based on the proposed approach and the results confirm its effectiveness in decreasing node capture impact. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Node capture attack; Random key predistribution scheme; Secure routing; Vulnerability model,Distributed computer systems; Matrix algebra; Network security; Sensor nodes; Articulation points; Attacking strategy; Average routing path; Node capture attack; Random key predistribution; Secure routing; Vulnerability matrixes; Vulnerability models; Wireless sensor networks,,,,,"He, X., Neidermeier, M., Meer, H., Dynamic key management in wireless sensor network: A survey (2013) Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 36, pp. 612-622; Aikyildiz, I.F., Su, W., Sankarasubramaniam, Y., Cayir, E., Wireless sensor networks: A survey (2002) Computer Networks, 38 (4), pp. 393-422; Zhang, J., Varadharajan, V., Wireless sensor network key management survey and taxonomy (2010) Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 33, pp. 63-75; Eschenauer, L., Gligor, V., A key-management scheme for distributed sensor networks (2002) In Proceedings of 9th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 41-47; Chan, H., Perrig, A., Song, D., Random key predistribution schemes for sensor networks.

However, the increasing reliance on machine learning on information and communication technologies makes it inherently vulnerable to cyber threats. This work aims to develop secure distributed algorithms to protect the learning from adversaries. We establish a game-theoretic framework to capture the conflicting goals of a learner who uses distributed support vector machines (DSVM) and an attacker who is capable of flipping training labels. We develop a fully distributed and iterative algorithm to capture real-time reactions of the learner at each node to adversarial behaviors. The numerical results show that DSVM is vulnerable to attacks, and their impact has a strong dependence on the network topologies. © 2017 IEEE.",,Artificial intelligence; Data handling; Game theory; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Support vector machines; Distributed machine learning; Game theoretic analysis; Information and Communication Technologies; Iterative algorithm; Massive data sets; Network topology; Numerical results; Strong dependences; Learning algorithms,,,,,"Bekkerman, R., Bilenko, M., Langford, J., (2011) Scaling Up Machine Learning: Parallel and Distributed Approaches, , Cambridge University Press; Metzger, J., Schillo, M., Fischer, K., A multiagent-based peer-to-peer network in Java for distributed spam filtering (2003) Multi-Agent Systems and Applications, 3, pp. 616-625. , Springer; Camponogara, E., Kraus, W., Jr., Distributed learning agents in urban traffic control (2003) Progress in Artificial Intelligence, pp. 324-335. , Springer; Nelson, B., Barreno, M., Jack Chi, F., Joseph, A.D., Rubinstein, B.I., Saini, U., Sutton, C., Xia, K., Misleading learners: Co-opting your spam filter (2009) Machine Learning in Cyber Trust, pp. 17-51. , Springer; Wood, A.D., Stankovic, J., Denial of service in sensor networks (2002) Computer, 35 (10), pp. 54-62; Drevin, L., Kruger, H.A., Steyn, T., Value-focused assessment of ict security awareness in an academic environment (2007) Computers & Security, 26 (1), pp. 36-43; Globerson, A., Roweis, S., Nightmare at test time: Robust learning by feature deletion (2006) Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Machine Learning.

The challenge of intrusion detection is further complicated because, as advances are made in the ability to detect attacks, similar advances are made by adversaries to thwart those detective measures. Although numerous machine learning algorithms and approaches have proven effective in detecting cyberattacks, these algorithms have limitations, especially in dealing with adversarial environments. This study addresses the problem that there is not an effective machine learning algorithm that minimizes human interaction to train and evolve the learner to adapt to changing cyberattacks and evasive tactics. This research concludes that selective sampling of unlabeled data for classification by a human expert can result in more efficient labeling for large datasets and demonstrates a more resilient approach to machine learning that utilizes active learning to interact with human subject matter experts and that adapts to changing data, thus addressing issues related to data tampering and evasion. © 2017 IEEE.",Active learning; Adversarial evasion; Intrusion detection; K-means clustering; KDD-CUP 99; Machine learning; Random forest; Tampering,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Mercury (metal); Active Learning; Adversarial evasion; K-means clustering; KDD-CUP 99; Random forests; Tampering; Learning algorithms,,,,,"Denning, D.E., Neumann, P.G., Requirements and model for IDES - A real-time intrusion detection expert system (1985) Document A005, SRI International, 333; Denning, D.E., An intrusion-detection model (1987) IEEE Trans. on Software Engineering, 2, pp. 222-232; Barbará, D., Couto, J., Jajodia, S., Popyack, L., Wu, N., ADAM: Detecting intrusions by data mining (2001) Proc.

These communities present a special case where access to national power networks is either non-existent or intermittent due to load-shedding to provision urban areas and/or due to high interconnection costs. By necessity, such micro-grids rely on renewable energy sources that are variable and so only partly predictable. Ensuring reliable power provisioning and billing must therefore be supported by demand management and fair-billing policies. Furthermore, since trusted centralized grid management is not always possible, using a distributed model offers a viable solution approach. However, such a distributed system may be subject to subversion attacks aimed at power theft. In this paper, we present a novel and innovative distributed architecture for power distribution and billing on micro-grids. The architecture is designed to operate efficiently over a lossy communication network, which is an advantage for disadvantaged communities. Since lossy networks are undependable, differentiating system failures from adversarial manipulations is important because grid stability is to a large extent dependent on user participation. To this end, we provide a characterization of potential adversarial models to underline how these can be differentiated from failures. © 2017 IEEE.",Lossy Networks; Resource Contrained Computing; Smart Micro-Grid Architecture; Wireless and Mobile Networks,Network architecture; Renewable energy resources; Systems engineering; Cost-effective approach; Distributed architecture; Distributed modeling; Interconnection costs; Lossy networks; Renewable energy source; Resource Contrained Computing; Smart Micro Grids; Electric power transmission networks,,,,,"Liu, Z., Chapter 3-a global energy outlook (2015) Global Energy Interconnection, pp. 91-100. , Z.

Despite this, practical and efficient countermeasures against such attacks are still lacking. In this paper, we propose keyboard randomization as a simple, yet effective, countermeasure against various types of keystroke inference attacks. Our proposal consists of several keyboard randomization strategies which randomizes or changes the position of keys on the keyboard. The randomized keyboard is then projected to the typing user by means of an augmented reality wearable device. As the randomized keyboard is visually superimposed over the actual physical keyboard, and is visible only to the typing user through the augmented reality device, it acts as an effective countermeasure against both side-channel and visual-channel based keystroke inference attacks. We implement our proposed solution on a commercially available augmented reality device and conduct preliminary evaluations to validate its performance and effectiveness. © 2017 IEEE.",Augmented reality; Eavesdropping; Keystroke inference; Random keyboard,Random processes; Security systems; Side channel attack; Ubiquitous computing; Eavesdropping; Inference attacks; Keystroke inference; Privacy threats; Random keyboard; Shoulder surfing; Visual channels; Wearable devices; Augmented reality,,,,,"Roth, V., Richter, K., Freidinger, R., A PIN-entry method resilient against shoulder surfing ACM CCS 2004; Kwon, T., Shin, S., Na, S., Covert attentional shoulder surfing: Human adversaries are more powerful than expected (2014) IEEE Transactions on SMC: Systems, 44 (6); Vuagnoux, M., Pasini, S., Compromising electromagnetic emanations of wired and wireless keyboards USENIX Security 2009; Berger, Y., Wool, A., Yeredor, A., Dictionary attacks using keyboard acoustic emanations ACM CCS 2006; Marquardt, P., Verma, A., Carter, H., Traynor, P., (sp) iPhone: Decoding vibrations from nearby keyboards using mobile phone accelerometers ACM CCS 2011; Maiti, A., Armbruster, O., Jadliwala, M., He, J., Smartwatch-based keystroke inference attacks and context-aware protection mechanisms ACM ASIACCS 2016; Ali, K., Liu, A.X., Wang, W., Shahzad, M., Keystroke recognition using WiFi signals ACM MobiCom 2015; Scramble Keypad SP-100, , www.swhouse.com/products; Ryu, Y.S., Koh, D.H., Aday, B.L., Gutierrez, X.A., Platt, J.D., Usability evaluation of randomized keypad (2010) Journal of Usability Studies, 5 (2), pp. 65-75; Moverio BT-200, , www.epson.com/MoverioBT200; Kumar, M., Garfinkel, T., Boneh, D., Winograd, T., Reducing shoulder-surfing by using gaze-based password entry ACM SOUPS 2007; Two Factor Authentication - Graphical Passwords, , www.realuser.com; Jermyn, I., Mayer, A., Monrose, F., Reiter, M.K., Rubin, A.D., The design and analysis of graphical passwords USENIX Security 1999; Tari, F., Ozok, A., Holden, S.H., A comparison of perceived and real shoulder-surfing risks between alphanumeric and graphical passwords ACM SOUPS 2006; Zhang, Y., Xia, P., Luo, J., Ling, Z., Liu, B., Fu, X., Fingerprint attack against touch-enabled devices (2012) ACM Workshop on Security and Privacy in Smartphones and Mobile Devices; Lashkari, A.H., Abdul Manaf, A., Masrom, M., Daud, S.M., DICTAP 2011, , Springer, ch.

Moving pressure, chemical and radiation sensors in a factory can have devastating consequences. Relocating roadside speed sensors, or smart meters without knowledge of command and control center can similarly wreck havoc. Consequently, authenticating geolocation of IoT devices is an important problem. Unfortunately, an IoT device itself may be compromised by an adversary. Hence, location information from the IoT device cannot be trusted. Thus, we have to rely on infrastructure to obtain a proximal location. Infrastructure routers may similarly be compromised. Therefore, there must be a way to authenticate trusted routers remotely. Unfortunately, IP packets may be blocked, hijacked or forged by an adversary. Therefore IP packets are not trustworthy either. Thus, we resort to covert channels for authenticating Internet packet routers as an intermediate step towards proximal geolocation of IoT devices. Several techniques have been proposed in the literature to obtain the geolocation of an edge device, but it has been shown that a knowledgeable adversary can circumvent these techniques. In this paper, we survey the state-of-the-art geolocation techniques and corresponding adversarial countermeasures to evade geolocation to justify the use of covert channels on networks. We propose a technique for determining proximal geolocation using covert channel. Challenges and directions for future work are also explored. © 2017 IEEE.",covert channel; geolocation; Internet of things; Internet Protocol; trusted router,Internet protocols; Routers; Tracking (position); Command and control centers; Covert channels; Geolocations; Internet packets; Location information; Radiation sensors; Speed sensors; State of the art; Internet of things,,,,,"Xia, F., Yang, L.T., Internet of things (2012) International Journal of Communication Systems, 25 (9), p. 1101; Han, L., Tan, J., The application of geo-information techniques for construction of lot (2011) Geomatics and Spatial Information Technology, 34, p.

Therefore, packets of these types will likely receive ""special"" treatment by a transit network or a man-in-the-middle attacker. A transit Internet Service Provider (ISP) or an attacker may pass the targeted traffic through special software or equipment to gather data or perform an attack. This creates a measurable difference between the performance of the targeted traffic versus the general case. In networking terms, it violates the principle of ""network neutrality,"" which states that all traffic should be treated equally. Many techniques were designed to detect network neutrality violations, and some have naturally suggested using them to detect surveillance and censorship. In this article, we show that the existing network neutrality measurement techniques can be easily detected and therefore circumvented.

To cope with this issue, a common countermeasure is the usage of cheap but wide-ranged sensors, able to detect suspicious events that occur in large areas, supporting patrollers to improve the effectiveness of their strategies. However, such sensors are commonly affected by uncertainty. In the present paper, we focus on spatially uncertain alarm signals. That is, the alarm system is able to detect an attack but it is uncertain on the exact position where the attack is taking place. This is common when the area to be secured is wide, such as in border patrolling and fair site surveillance. We propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first Patrolling Security Game where a Defender is supported by a spatially uncertain alarm system, which non-deterministically generates signals once a target is under attack. We show that finding the optimal strategy is FNP-hard even in tree graphs and APX-hard in arbitrary graphs. We provide two (exponential time) exact algorithms and two (polynomial time) approximation algorithms. Finally, we show that, without false positives and missed detections, the best patrolling strategy reduces to stay in a place, wait for a signal, and respond to it at best. This strategy is optimal even with non-negligible missed detection rates, which, unfortunately, affect every commercial alarm system. We evaluate our methods in simulation, assessing both quantitative and qualitative aspects. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Adversarial patrolling; Algorithmic game theory; Security games,Approximation algorithms; Game theory; Polynomial approximation; Trees (mathematics); Adversarial patrolling; Algorithmic Game Theory; Complex infrastructures; Missed detections; Optimal strategies; Qualitative aspects; Security games; Site surveillance; Alarm systems,,,,,"Jain, M., An, B., Tambe, M., An overview of recent application trends at the AAMAS conference: security, sustainability, and safety (2012) AI Mag., 33 (3), pp. 14-28; Von Stengel, B., Zamir, S., Leadership with commitment to mixed strategies (2004), Tech. rep; Conitzer, V., Sandholm, T., Computing the optimal strategy to commit to (2006) Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce, ACM EC, pp. 82-90; Pita, J., Jain, M., Western, C., Portway, C., Tambe, M., Ordóñez, F., Kraus, S., Paruchuri, P., Deployed ARMOR protection: the application of a game-theoretic model for security at the Los Angeles International Airport (2008) Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems, AAMAS, pp. 125-132; Tsai, J., Rathi, S., Kiekintveld, C., Ordóñez, F., Tambe, M., IRIS – A tool for strategic security allocation in transportation networks (2009) Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems, AAMAS, pp. 1327-1334; An, B., Shieh, E., Yang, R., Tambe, M., Baldwin, C., DiRenzo, J., Maule, B., Meyer, G., Protect – A deployed game theoretic system for strategic security allocation for the United States coast guard (2014) AI Mag., 33 (4), pp. 96-110; Delle Fave, F.M., Jiang, A.X., Yin, Z., Zhang, C., Tambe, M., Kraus, S., Sullivan, J., Game–theoretic security patrolling with dynamic execution uncertainty and a case study on a real transit system (2014) J.

The aim was to enhance services with location and context awareness. Although the hardware components of typical BLE Beacons systems are able to support adequate cryptography, the design and implementation of most pub- licly available BLE Beacon protocols appears to render them vulnerable to a plethora of attacks. Indeed, in this paper, we were able to perform user tracking, user behavior mon- itoring, spoofing as well as denial of service (DoS) of many supported services. Our aim is to show that these attacks stem from design aws of the underlying protocols and as- sumptions made for the BLE beacons protocols. Using a clearly defined threat model, we provide a formal analysis of the adversarial capabilities and requirements and the attack impact on security and privacy for the end-user. Contrary to popular belief, BLE technology can be exploited even by low-skilled adversaries leading to exposure of user informa- tion. To demonstrate our attacks in practice, we selected Apple's iBeacon technology, as a case study. However, our analysis can be easily generalized to other BLE Beacon tech- nologies. © 2017 ACM.",,Behavioral research; Network security; Bluetooth low energies (BLE); Context- awareness; Defined threats; Denial of Service; Design and implementations; Formal analysis; Hardware components; Security and privacy; Denial-of-service attack,,,,,"IBeacon Battery Drain on Apple Vs Android: A Technical Report, , http://www.aislelabs.com/reports/ibeacon-battery-drain-iphones/, Aislelabs Last Accessed: 02-12-2017; Allan, A., Mistry, S., Hacking the CES Scav-enger Hunt, , http://makezine.com/2014/01/03/hacking-the-ces-scavenger-hunt/, Last Accessed: 02-12-2017; Allan, A., Mistry, S., Hacking the CES Scavenger Hunt for A Second Time, , http://makezine.com/2016/01/07/hacking-ces-scavenger-hunt-second-time/, Last Accessed: 02-12-2017; Proximity Beacon Specification R1, , https://developer.apple.com/ibeacon/, Apple Last Accessed: 02-12-2017; Ashbridge, M., Eddystone Protocol Specification, , https://github.com/google/eddystone/blob/master/protocol-specification.md, Last Accessed: 02-12-2017; Specification of the Bluetooth System, Covered Core Package Ver-sion: 4.0., , https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/bluetooth-core-specification, T.

One prerequisite in such classification is to properly choose training documents. Active learning emerges as a technique to achieve better accuracy with fewer training documents by choosing data to learn and querying oracles for unknown labels. In practice, such oracles are usually human analysts who are likely to make mistakes or, in some cases, even intentionally introduce erroneous labels for malicious purposes. We propose a risk-factor based strategy to defend active-learning-based document classification against human mistakes or adversarial inputs. We show that the proposed strategy can substantially alleviate the damage caused by malicious labeling. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our defense strategy in terms of maintaining accuracy against adversaries. © 2016 IEEE.",Active learning; Document classification; Malicious inputs; Security and attacks,Artificial intelligence; Digital storage; Learning systems; Active Learning; Defense strategy; Document Classification; Large volumes; Machine learning techniques; Malicious inputs; Security and attacks; Training documents; Information retrieval systems,,,,,"Huang, J., Lu, J., Ling, C.X., Comparing naive bayes, decision trees, and SVM with auc and accuracy (2003) Proc. of IEEE InternationalConference on DataMining (ICDM), pp. 553-556; Sebastiani, F., Machine learning in automated text categorization (2002) ACM Computing Surveys, 34 (1), pp. 1-47; Nigam, K., McCallum, A.K., Thrun, S., Mitchell, T., Text classification from labeled and unlabeled documents using em (2000) Machine Learning, 39 (2-3), pp. 103-134; Tong, S., Koller, D., Support vector machine active learning with applications to text classification (2002) The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 2, pp. 45-66; Pasolli, E., Melgani, F., Tuia, D., Pacifici, F., Emery, W.J., SVM active learning approach for image classification using spatial information (2014) IEEE Trans.

Distributed Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) allow accurate clock-synchronized measurements of voltage and current phasors (amplitudes, phase angles) and frequencies. The sensor data from PMUs provide situational awareness in the grid, and are used as input for control decisions. A modification of sensor data can severely impact grid stability, overall power supply, and physical devices. Since power grids are critical infrastructures, WAMSs are tempting targets for all kinds of attackers, including well-organized and motivated adversaries such as terrorist groups or adversarial nation states. Such groups possess sufficient resources to launch sophisticated attacks. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of attack possibilities on WAMSs. We model the dependencies and building blocks of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) on WAMSs using attack trees. We consider the whole WAMS infrastructure, including aggregation and data collection points, such as Phasor Data Concentrators (PDCs), classical IT components, and clock synchronization. Since Smart Grids are cyber-physical systems, we consider physical perturbations, in addition to cyber attacks in our models. The models provide valuable information about the chain of cyber or physical attack steps that can be combined to build a sophisticated attack for reaching a higher goal. They assist in the assessment of physical and cyber vulnerabilities, and provide strategic guidance for the deployment of suitable countermeasures. © 2017 ACM.",Attack model; Attack tree; Security issues; Sophisticated attacks; Wide area monitoring security,Clocks; Computer crime; Embedded systems; Forestry; Network security; Phasor measurement units; Smart power grids; Terrorism; Units of measurement; Attack model; Attack tree; Security issues; Sophisticated attacks; Wide area monitoring; Electric power transmission networks,,,,,"Searle, J., Rasche, G., Wright, A., Dinnage, S., (2016) NESCOR Guide to Penetration Testing for Electric Utilities; Chen, P., Desmet, L., Huygens, C., (2014) A Study on Advanced Persistent Threats, pp. 63-72. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg, Berlin, Heidelberg; Schneier, B., Attack trees (1999) Dr. Dobb's Journal; Byres, E.J., Franz, M., Miller, D., (2004) The use of Attack Trees in Assessing Vulnerabilities in SCADA Systems; Yan, J., Govindarasu, M., Liu, C.-C., Ni, M., Vaidya, U., Risk assessment framework for power control systems with PMU-based intrusion response system (2015) Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy; Moore, A.P., Ellison, R.J., Linger, R.C., Attack modeling for information security and survivability (2001) Carnegie Mellon University; Grochocki, D., Huh, J.H., Berthier, R., Bobba, R., Sanders, W.H., Crdenas, A.A., Jetcheva, J.G., Ami threats, intrusion detection requirements and deployment recommendations (2012) 2012 IEEE Third International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm); Ten, C.W., Liu, C.C., Govindarasu, M., Vulnerability assessment of cyberse-curity for SCADA systems using attack trees (2007) 2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting; Chen, T.M., Sanchez-Aarnoutse, J.C., Buford, J., Petri net modeling of cyber-physical attacks on smart grid (2011) IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid; Reisig, W., (1985) Petri Nets: An Introduction, , Springer-Verlag New York, Inc., USA; Zseby, T., Fabini, J., Security challenges for wide area monitoring in smart grids (2014) Elektrotechnik und Informationstechnik; Blask, C., Lee, A., (2013) NESCOR Electric Sector Failure Scenarios and Impact Analyses, , Technical report; Dan, G., Sandberg, H., Ekstedt, M., Bjrkman, G., Challenges in power system information security (2012) IEEE Security Privacy; Paudel, S., Smith, P., Zseby, T., Data integrity attacks in smart grid wide area monitoring (2016) 4th International Symposium for ICS and SCADA Cyber Security Research; Dehghani, M., Khalafi, Z., Khalili, A., Sami, A., Integrity attack detection in PMU networks using static state estimation algorithm PowerTech, 2015 IEEE; Taha, A.F., Qi, J., Wang, J., Panchal, J.H., Risk mitigation for dynamic state estimation against cyber attacks and unknown inputs (2015) The Computing Research Repository; Pal, S., Sikdar, B., Chow, J., Real-time detection of packet drop attacks on synchrophasor data (2014) Smart Grid Communications, IEEE International Conference; Rahman, M.A., Al-Shaer, E., Bera, P., A noninvasive threat analyzer for advanced metering infrastructure in smart grid (2013) IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid; Jauhar, S., Model-based cybersecurity assessment with NESCOR smart grid failure scenarios (2015) IEEE 21st Pacific Rim International Symposium on Dependable Computing; Cazorla, L., Alcaraz, C., Lopez, J., Cyber stealth attacks in critical information infrastructures (2016) IEEE Systems Journal; Kezunovic, M., Popovic, T., Muehrcke, C., Isle, B., Harp, S., Sisley, E., Ayyorgun, S., (2012) NESCOR Wide Area Monitoring, Protection, and Control Systems: Standards for Cyber Security Requirements, , [Online; accessed 31-January-2017]; IEC 61850 - Communication Networks and Systems in Substations, , IEC-61850; (2010) White Paper - Substation Automation for the Smart Grid, , CISCO; Adamiak, M., Baigent, D., Mackiewicz, R., (2010) IEC 61850 Communication Networks and Systems in Substations; Kim, T.T., Poor, H.V., Strategic protection against data injection attacks on power grids (2011) IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid; Jiang, X., Zhang, J., Harding, B.J., Makela, J.J., Dominguez-Garca, A.D., Spoofing GPS receiver clock offset of phasor measurement units (2013) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems",,,ACM Special Interest Group on Embedded Systems (SIGBED);IEEE CS;IEEE Signal Processing Society,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","2nd Workshop on Cyber-Physical Security and Resilience in Smart Grids, CPSR-SG 2017",21-Apr-17,,127336,,9.78145E+12,,,English,"Proc. - Workshop Cyber-Phys.

However, existing studies were often conducted under a less adversarial setting, in that they ignore the possibility that an alert attacker can also try to detect the activation of MTD and then cancel any FDI attack until they learn the new system configuration after MTD. Indeed, in this paper, we show that this can be achieved easily by the attacker. To improve the stealthiness of MTD against the attacker, we propose a hidden MTD approach that maintains the power flows of the whole grid after MTD. We develop an algorithm to construct the hidden MTD and analyze its feasibility condition when only a subset of transmission lines can adjust susceptance. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the hidden MTD against alert attackers under realistic settings. © 2017 ACM.",False data injection attack; Moving target defense; Smart grid; State estimation,Electric lines; Network security; Smart power grids; State estimation; False data injection; False data injection attacks; Feasibility condition; Moving target defense; Power flows; Recent researches; Smart grid; System configurations; Electric power transmission networks,,,,,"Bobba, R.B., Rogers, K.M., Wang, Q., Khurana, H., Nahrstedt, K., Overbye, T.J., Detecting false data injection attacks on dc state estimation (2010) Workshop on Secure Control Systems; Davis, K.R., Morrow, K.L., Bobba, R., Heine, E., Power flow cyber attacks and perturbation-based defense (2012) SmartGridComm; Giani, A., Bitar, E., Garcia, M., McQueen, M., Khargonekar, P., Poolla, K., Smart grid data integrity attacks: Characterizations and countermeasures (2011) SmartGridComm; Huang, Y., Li, H., Campbell, K.A., Han, Z., Defending false data injection attack on smart grid network using adaptive cusum test (2011) Annual Conf.

The essential part of an SDN-based network are flow rules that enable network elements to steer and control the traffic and deploy policy enforcement points with a fine granularity at any entry-point in a network. Such applications, implemented with the usage of OpenFlow rules, are already integral components of widely used SDN controllers such as Floodlight or OpenDayLight.

In this paper we introduce a new attack vector on SDN by showing how the detailed composition of flowrules can be reconstructed by network users without any prior knowledge of the SDN controller or its architecture. To our best knowledge, in SDN, such reconnaissance techniques have not been considered so far. We introduce SDNMap, an open-source scanner that is able to accurately reconstruct the detailed composition of flow rules by performing active probing and listening to the network traffic. We demonstrate in a number of real-world SDN applications that this ability provides adversaries with a significant attack advantage and discuss ways to prevent the introduced reconnaissance techniques.

To secure the communications, secret session keys need to be established between wireless devices. In existing symmetric key establishment protocols, it is assumed that devices are pre-loaded with secrets. In the CPS, however, wireless devices are produced by different companies. It is not practical to assume that the devices are pre-loaded with certain secrets when they leave companies. As a consequence, existing symmetric key establishment protocols cannot be directly implemented in the CPS. Motivated by these observations, this paper presents a cross-layer key establishment model for heterogeneous wireless devices in the CPS. Specifically, by implementing our model, wireless devices extract master keys (shared with the system authority) at the physical layer using ambient wireless signals. Then, the system authority distributes secrets for devices (according to an existing symmetric key establishment protocol) by making use of the extracted master keys. Completing these operations, wireless devices can establish secret session keys at higher layers by calling the employed key establishment protocol. Additionally, we prove the security of the proposed model. We analyse the performance of the new model by implementing it and converting existing symmetric key establishment protocols into cross-layer key establishment protocols. © 2017 ACM.",Cross-layer; Cyber-physical systems; Key establishment; Security; Wireless devices,Embedded systems; Network layers; Radio; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cross layer; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Key establishment protocol; Key establishments; Security; Wireless communications; Wireless devices; Wireless signals; Cyber Physical System,,,,,"IEEE standard for local and metropolitan area networks-part 15.4: Low-rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs) (2011) IEEE Std 802.15.4-2011 (Revision of IEEE Std 802.15.4-2006), pp. 1-314. , Sept; Ali, S., Qaisar, S.B., Saeed, H., Khan, M.F., Naeem, M., Anpalagan, A., Network challenges for cyber physical systems with tiny wireless devices: A case study on reliable pipeline condition monitoring (2015) Sensors, 15 (4), pp. 7172-7205; Bahl, P., Padmanabhan, V.N., RADAR: An in-building RF-based user location and tracking system (2000) Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM 2000, the Conference on Computer Communications, Nineteenth Annual Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies, Reaching the Promised Land of Communications, pp. 775-784. , Tel Aviv, Israel, March 26-30 IEEE, 2000; Blom, R., An optimal class of symmetric key generation systems (1984) Advances in Cryptology: Proceedings of EUROCRYPT 84, a Workshop on the Theory and Application of Of Cryptographic Techniques, Paris, France, April 9-11, 1984, Proceedings, Volume 209 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pp. 335-338. , T.

Potential attacks include having malicious content like malware identified as legitimate or controlling vehicle behavior. Yet, all existing adversarial example attacks require knowledge of either the model internals or its training data. We introduce the first practical demonstration of an attacker controlling a remotely hosted DNN with no such knowledge. Indeed, the only capability of our black-box adversary is to observe labels given by the DNN to chosen inputs. Our attack strategy consists in training a local model to substitute for the target DNN, using inputs synthetically generated by an adversary and labeled by the target DNN. We use the local substitute to craft adversarial examples, and find that they are misclassi fied by the targeted DNN. To perform a real-world and properly-blinded evaluation, we attack a DNN hosted by MetaMind, an online deep learning API. We find that their DNN misclassifies 84.24% of the adversarial examples crafted with our substitute. We demonstrate the general applicability of our strategy to many ML techniques by conducting the same attack against models hosted by Amazon and Google, using logistic regression substitutes. They yield adversarial examples misclassified by Amazon and Google at rates of 96.19% and 88.94%. We also find that this black-box attack strategy is capable of evading defense strategies previously found to make adversarial example crafting harder. © 2017 ACM.",,Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Education; Learning systems; Network security; Attack strategies; Controlling vehicles; Defense strategy; Human observers; Logistic regressions; Model outputs; Potential attack; Training data; Malware,,,,,"Barreno, M., Can machine learning be secure Proceedings of the 2006 ACM Symposium on Information, Computer and Communications Security; Biggio, B., Evasion attacks against machine learning at test time (2013) Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases, pp. 387-402. , Springer; Goodfellow, I., (2016) Deep Learning, , www.deeplearningbook.org, Book in preparation for MIT Press; Goodfellow, I.J., Explaining and harnessing adversarial examples (2015) Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations; Huang, L., Adversarial machine learning (2011) Proceedings of the 4th ACM workshop on Security and artificial intelligence, pp. 43-58; Kurakin, A., (2016) Adversarial Examples in the Physical World, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1607.02533; LeCun, Y., (1998) The Mnist Database of Handwritten Digits; Lehmann, E.L., (2008) Testing Statistical Hypotheses, , Springer Texts in Statistics, August; Papernot, N., The limitations of deep learning in adversarial settings (2016) Proceedings of the 1st IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy; Papernot, N., Distillation as a defense to adversarial perturbations against deep neural networks Proceedings of the 37th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy; Sharif, M., Accessorize to a crime: Real and stealthy attacks on state-of-The-Art face recognition (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security, , ACM; Srndic, N., Practical evasion of a learning-based classier: A case study Proceeding of the 35th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy; Stallkamp, J., Man vs. Computer: Benchmarking machine learning algorithms for trafic sign recognition (2012) Neural Networks, 32, pp. 323-332; Szegedy, C., Intriguing properties of neural networks (2014) Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations; Tramer, F., Stealing machine learning models via prediction apis (2016) 25th USENIX Security Symposium; Vitter, J.S., Random sampling with a reservoir (1985) ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software; Warde-Farley, D., Adversarial perturbations of deep neural networks (2016) Advanced Structured Prediction; Xu, W., Automatically evading classiers Proceedings of the 2016 Network and Distributed Systems Symposium",,,ACM SIGSAC,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","2017 ACM Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security, ASIA CCS 2017",2 April 2017 through 6 April 2017,,127187,,9.78145E+12,,,English,ASIA CCS - Proc.

Among many secure MPC primitives, Shamir's secret sharing (SSS) has the advantages of having low complexity and information-theoretic security. However, SSS requires multiple honest participants and is susceptible to collusion attacks. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of different types of collusion attacks and propose novel mechanisms to deter such attacks in a fully distributed manner. Focusing on outsourced computing environments where secret data owners can collaborate on a public computing platform, we study collusion attacks using game theory. For those attacks where the thefts are detectable, we show that they can be effectively deterred by an explicit retaliation mechanism between data owners. The result is based on a comprehensive analysis that takes into account the cost of collusion, the privacy preference, and the associated uncertainty. For those attacks where the thefts cannot be detected, we expand the analysis to include the computing platform and provide deterrence through deceptive collusion requests as well as a novel cryptographic censorship protocol. The correctness and the privacy of the protocols are proved under the rational adversarial model. Our SSS-based protocols are shown to outperform the state-of-the-art garbled circuit systems, while our simulation results validate the proposed mechanism designs in deterring collusion. © 2016 IEEE.",collusion attacks; Game-Theoretic mechanism design; multi-party computation; Outsource computing; Shamir's secret sharing,Computer games; Game theory; Machine design; Network security; Uncertainty analysis; Collusion attack; Computing environments; Distributed computations; Information- theoretic securities; Mechanism design; Multiparty computation; Secret sharing; Secure multi-party computation; Information theory,,,,,"Liu, C., Wang, X.S., Nayak, K., Huang, Y., Shi, E., ObliVM: A programming framework for secure computation (2015) Proc.

We assume that the central computer can be under attack and we propose a strategy where the sensor retains a limited amount of the data to counteract the effect of attack. We formulate the problem as a two player game in which the sensor (defender) chooses an optimal fusion strategy using both the non-trusted output from the central computer and locally stored trusted data. The attacker seeks to compromise the computation by influencing the fused value through malicious manipulation of the data stored on the central computer. We first characterize all Nash equilibria of this game, which turn out to be dependent on parameters known to both players. Next we adopt an Iterated Best Response (IBR) scheme in which, at each iteration, the central computer reveals its output to the sensor, who then computes its best response based on a linear combination of its private local estimate and the untrusted third-party output. We characterize necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence of the IBR along with numerical results which show that the convergence conditions are relatively tight. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Adversarial machine learning; Computational methods; Game theory; Iterated Best Response,Computation theory; Computational methods; Game theory; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Sensor data fusion; Computing power; Convergence analysis; Convergence conditions; Iterated best response; Linear combinations; Nash equilibria; Numerical results; Two-player games; Computer games,,,,,"Achlioptas, D., McSherry, F., Fast computation of low rank matrix approximations (2007) Journal of the ACM, 52 (2); Biggio, B., Nelson, B., Laskov, P., Poisoning attacks against support vector machines (2012) Int'l conf. on machine learning, ICML; Bopardikar, S.D., Speranzon, A., Langbort, C., Trusted computation with an adversarial cloud (2014) Proceedings of the American Control Conference, pp. 2445-2452; Bopardikar, S.D., Speranzon, A., Langbort, C., (2016) Convergence analysis of iterated best response for a trusted computation game, , https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02329, Arxiv report.

Internet, cloud access, online banking, instant messaging, and file exchange through the cloud are just a handful of the myriad of smartphone services that we make use of every day. At the same time, the very enablers of these services–mobile internet providers and cloud platforms that host them–pose several threats to the anonymity of our communications. In this paper, we consider the problem of providing end-to-end anonymous communications and file exchange under the cooperative privacy threat of involved parties including network operators and cloud providers, which actively tamper with the communication. We propose a solution for delay-tolerant applications (similar to Whatsapp or Email) and prove the security properties of the protocol under this strong attack model.

This paper provides a user-centric analysis of trajectory privacy protection against tracking attacks in presence of quality-loss and energy constraints, focusing on impact of user query behavior within a certain period of time. We consider an attacker with adversarial knowledge on users’ activity and mobility profiles to run tracking attacks, against which users employ LPPMs that incorporate location semantic diversity to maximize trajectory privacy. The attack and defense problems are formalized as a Bayesian Stackelberg game for quantitative analysis. Real location traces are used to assess the LPPMs’ effectiveness, and to find optimal query strategy. The results confirm that query behavior has a significant impact on improving trajectory privacy. Despite increased number of queries to improve trajectory privacy, the effectiveness may be decreased with a longer observation time. At the same query rate, prolonging observation time is beneficial for privacy improvement. We also find that dummy-based LPPM often provides better protection with a stringent energy constraint, while precision-based LPPM performs better under a stringent quality-loss constraint or under a loose energy constraint. At optimal trajectory privacy, quality-loss of precision-based LPPM is lower than that of dummy-based LPPM, but there is an opposite result in terms of energy cost. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Location privacy protection mechanism; Location-based service; Query behavior; Tracking attack; Trajectory privacy,Behavioral research; Data privacy; Location; Quality control; Semantics; Telecommunication services; Trajectories; Bayesian stackelberg games; Evaluation methods; Location privacy protection; Optimal trajectories; Privacy protection; Query behavior; Tracking attacks; User query behaviors; Location based services,,,,,"Niu, B., Qinghua, L., Xiaoyan, Z., Hui, L., A fine-grained spatial cloaking scheme for privacy-aware users in location-based services (2014) Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN), pp. 1-8; Niu, B., Qinghua, L., Xiaoyan, Z., Guohong, C., Hui, L., Enhancing privacy through caching in location-based services (2015) Proceedings of the 34st Annual IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM), pp. 1017-1025; Gierlichs, B., Carmela, T., Claudia, D., Bart, P., Ingrid, V., (2008) Revisiting a combinatorial approach toward measuring anonymity.

A few proposals have been proposed for privacy preserving trajectory data publishing, and most of them assume the attacks with the same adversarial background knowledge. In practice, different users have different privacy requirements. Such non-personalized privacy assumption does not meet the personalized privacy requirements, meanwhile, it looses the chance to achieve better utility by taking advantage of differences of users' privacy requirements.We study the personalized trajectory k-anonymity criterion for trajectory data publication. Specifically, we explore and propose an overall framework which provides privacy preserving services based on users' personal privacy requests, including trajectory clustering, editing and publication. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our scheme through experiments on real world dataset. © 2017 Chinese Institute of Electronics.",Personalization; Privacy-preserving data publishing; Trajectory data,Trajectories; Back-ground knowledge; Personalizations; Privacy preserving; Privacy Preserving Data Publishing; Privacy requirements; Trajectory clustering; Trajectory data; Trajectory data publications; Data privacy,,,,,"Güting, R.H., Schneider, M., (2005) Moving Objects Databases, , Morgan Kaufmann; Zheng, V.W., Zheng, Y., Xie, X., Yang, Q., Collaborative location and activity recommendations with GPS history data (2010) Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on World Wide Web, WWW '10, ACM, pp. 1029-1038. , New York, USA; Li, Q., Zheng, Y., Xie, X., Chen, Y., Liu, W., Ma, W., Mining user similarity based on location history (2008) Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems, GIS '08, pp. 341-3410. , New York, NY, USA; Abul, O., Bonchi, F., Nanni, M., Anonymization of moving objects databases by clustering and perturbation (2010) Information Systems, 35 (8), pp. 884-910; Yarovoy, R., Bonchi, F., Lakshmanan, L.V.S., Wang, W.H., Anonymizing moving objects: How to hide a mob in a crowd?

At any time instant, the designer aims to operate the network in an optimal topology within the set of policy compliant topologies with respect to a desired network property. Simultaneously, the adversary counters the designer trying to force operation in a suboptimal topology. Specifically, if the designer and the attacker choose the same link in the current topology to defend/grow and attack, respectively, then the latter is thwarted. However, if the defender does not correctly guess where the attacker is going to attack, and, hence, acts elsewhere, the topology reverts to the best policy-compliant configuration after a successful attack. We show the existence of various mixed strategy equilibria in this game and systematically study its structural properties. We study the effect of parameters, such as probability of a successful attack, and characterize the steady state behavior of the underlying Markov chain. While the intuitive adversarial strategy here is to attack the most important links, the Nash equilibrium strategy is for the designer to defend the most crucial links and for the adversary to focus attack on the lesser crucial links. We validate these properties through two use cases with example sets of network topologies. Next, we consider a multi-stage framework where the designer is not only interested in the instantaneous network property costs but a discounted sum of costs over many time instances. We establish structural properties of the equilibrium strategies in the multi-stage setting, and also demonstrate that applying algorithms based on the Q-Learning and Rollout methods can result in significant benefits for the designer compared with strategies resulting from a one-shot based game. © 2017 IEEE.",game theory; multi-stage games; Network design; topology control,Game theory; Markov processes; Structural properties; Adversarial environments; Equilibrium strategy; Multi stage games; Nash equilibrium strategies; Network design; Network topology designs; Steady-state behaviors; Topology control; Topology,,,,,"Ciftcioglu, E.N., Topology design under adversarial environments (2016) Proc.

Such networks are difficult to design because, being inherently complex, they are vulnerable to attack. As a result, the current process of designing secure protocols for wireless ad hoc networks is effectively an arms race between discovering attacks and creating fixes. At no point in the process is it possible to make provable performance and security guarantees. This paper proposes a system-theoretic framework for the design of secure open wireless ad hoc networks, that provides precisely such guarantees. The nodes are initially unsynchronized, and join the network at any stage of the operation. The framework consists of a zero-sum game between all protocols and adversarial strategies, in which the protocol is announced before the adversarial strategy. Each choice of protocol and adversarial strategy results in a payoff. The design imperative is to choose the protocol that achieves the optimal payoff. We propose an ""edge-tally supervised"" merge protocol that is theoretically significant in three ways. First, the protocol achieves the max-min payoff; the highest possible payoff since the adversarial strategy always knows the protocol a priori. Second, the protocol actually does better and achieves the min-max payoff; it is a Nash equilibrium in the space of protocols and adversarial strategies. The adversarial nodes gain no advantage from knowing the protocol a priori. Third, the adversarial nodes are effectively limited to either jamming or conforming to the protocol; more complicated behaviors yield no strategic benefit. © 2016 IEEE.",Ad hoc wireless networks; security,Ad hoc networks; Embedded systems; Game theory; Wireless ad hoc networks; Wireless networks; Ad hoc wireless; Ad hoc wireless networks; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Merge protocols; Nash equilibria; Secure protocols; security; Strategic benefits; Network security,,,,,"Choi, J., Chiang, J.T., Kim, D., Hu, Y.-C., (2010) Partial Deafness: A Novel Denial-of-Service Attack in 802.11 Networks, 50, pp. 235-252. , New York, NY, USA: Springer-Verlag; Chun Hu, Y., Perrig, A., Johnson, D.B., Wormhole attacks in wireless networks (2006) IEEE J.

On a second step, assuming that the attacker is aware of the fact that the detector takes countermeasures, we investigate a possible way for him to react. Then, we study the interplay between the defender and the attacker when both of them try to do their best for pursuing their opposite goals. We focus our analysis on the metadetection of oracle attacks based on line search algorithms, as they are prevalent in the literature. In such scenario, we propose metadetectors, which work under very general conditions, that is, when the oracle is not exclusively fed with line search attacking queries, but only some of the malicious queries are made along the lines, whereas the others are done by mimicking the behavior of honest users. We theoretically evaluate the final achievable performance of these metadetectors, deriving conditions under which asymptotic powerful testing is possible. Experimental results show the power of metadetection for countering the line search attacks in both synthetic and real application scenarios. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",Adversarial signal processing; composite hypothesis testing; intentional attacks; sample covariance matrix (high-dimensionality regime); singular value decomposition; zero-bit watermarking,Covariance matrix; Singular value decomposition; Achievable performance; Composite hypothesis testing; High dimensionality; Intentional Attacks; Line search algorithm; Oracle attacks; Real applications; Smart detection; Signal processing,,,,,"Barni, M., Pérez-González, F., Coping with the enemy: Advances in adversary-aware signal processing (2013) Proc.

While distributiveness and scalability are attractive features, these facets also increase exposure to malicious peers which can propagate malicious routing information. Accordingly, a diverse set of continuously evolving attacks can be mounted that can cause severe service impairments over the entire overlay network. Most proposed countermeasures focus on providing diversity or redundancy to overcome malicious routing information with their emphasis on periodic detection/removal mechanisms done locally within a peer as continuous monitoring or global sharing of peer status entails high costs. However, a local approach naturally also limits the global effectiveness prompting the need for distributed solutions. In this work, we build upon contemporary distributed solutions (that developed specific attack detection and mitigation techniques for specific overlay types and specific attacks), to propose a generalized attack detection and mitigation approach applicable to varied overlay and attack models. Consequently, we propose a novel and efficient routing table sanitizing approach that (a) is independent of a specific attack variant, lookup approach or a specific victim set, (b) continuously detects and subsequently removes malicious routing information based on distributed quorum decisions, and (c) efficiently forwards malicious information findings to other peers which allows for progressive global sanitizing. The generalized mechanism shows a high sanitizing accuracy of up to 90% when evaluated against a generalized attack scenario with various adversarial behaviors. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Attacks; Detection;

Attack identification is often critical for the recovery and performance of a CPS that is targeted by malicious entities, allowing defenders to construct algorithms which bypass harmful nodes. Previous work has characterized limitations in the perfect identification of adversarial attacks on deterministic LTI systems. For instance, a system must remain observable after removing any 2q sensors to only identify q attacks. However, the ability for an attacker to create an unidentifiable attack requires knowledge of the system model. In this paper, we aim to limit the adversary's knowledge of the system model with the goal of accurately identifying all sensor attacks. Such a scheme will allow systems to withstand larger attacks or system operators to allocate fewer sensing devices to a control system while maintaining security. We explore how changing the dynamics of the system as a function of time allows us to actively identify malicious/faulty sensors in a control system. We discuss the design of time varying system matrices to meet this goal and evaluate performance in deterministic and stochastic systems. © 2016 IEEE.",,Control systems; Embedded systems; Linear systems; Stochastic control systems; Stochastic systems; Time varying systems; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Function of time; Malicious entity; Moving targets; Sensing devices; System modeling; System operator; Unidentifiable attacks; Cyber Physical System,,,,,"Cárdenas, A.A., Amin, S., Sastry, S.S., Secure control: Towards survivable cyber-physical systems (2008) Distributed Computing Systems Workshops, 2008.

We propose a game-theoretic model in which the objective of the attacker (resp. defender) is to maximize the number of undetected attacks (resp. detections) on the network. Our game is strategically equivalent to a zero-sum game. Thus, the Nash Equilibria (NE) solution can be found by solving two linear programming (LP) problems. Still, characterization of equilibrium strategies is not tractable for large-scale networks. We assume that the defender's (resp. attacker's) detection (resp. attack) budget is limited relative to the size of the network. Under this assumption, we provide structural results on the equilibrium payoffs based on the players' resources and the size of the minimum set covers. We show that an equilibrium strategy of the defender is to choose a randomized sensing strategy that spans a minimum set cover. This result significantly improves the tractability of NE computation, and provides some practical insights on network sensing in adversarial environments. © 2016 IEEE.",,Budget control; Game theory; Adversarial environments; Equilibrium strategy; Game-theoretic model; Large-scale network; Minimum set cover; Nash equilibria; Network-sensing; Security failure; Linear programming,,,,,"Narayanan, I., Vasan, A., Sarangan, V., Sivasubramaniam, A., One meter to find them all: Water network leak localization using a single flow meter (2014) Proceedings of the 13th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, Ser.

Solutions for enabling information security in BANs require extensive use of cryptographic primitives that involve considerable performance overhead. Consequently, information security is typically not available in wearable technologies. We need adaptive security solutions that increase the level of security in the event of threats but otherwise impose minimal security overhead in order for them to viable for BANs. The first step in building adaptive security for BANs is to detect the threats. In this paper we propose a solution for detecting adversaries attacking the communication channel of a BAN called a wearable honeypot system. It works by communicating fake user health information between the base station and a set of designated decoy nodes in the BAN. Any alteration of this traffic, in content or arrival time, is considered adversarial tampering. A preliminary implementation of this wearable honeypot system demonstrates that it is effective in detecting a variety of communication attacks on a BAN. © 2016 IEEE.",,Network security; Security of data; Adaptive security; Arrival time; Body area networks; Cryptographic primitives; Health informations; In-buildings; Security overheads; Wearable networks; Wearable technology,,,,,"Galante, A., Kokos, A., Zanero, S., Bluebat: Towards practical bluetooth honeypots (2009) IEEE Int.

One of the main challenges in cyber-physical systems is the vulnerability to adversarial attacks. As the important module in cyber physical systems, sensor measurements are prone to malicious attacks due to the use of open computation and communication architectures. This paper proposes an adaptive sliding mode observer for state estimation of systems subjected to adversarial attacks. The novelty of the method considered here lies in the use of the equivalent control concept to explicitly reconstruct attack signals and consequently the system state. A design procedure is described and simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2016 IEEE.",Adaptive sliding mode observers; Attack reconstruction; Cyber-physical systems; Equivalent control,Cyber Physical System; Cybernetics; Embedded systems; Linear systems; Sliding mode control; State estimation; Adaptive sliding mode observer; Communication architectures; Communication modules; Design procedure; Equivalent control; Physical systems; Research activities; Sensor measurements; Adaptive control systems,,,,,"Pasqualetti, F., Dorfler, F., Bullo, F., (2012) Attack Detection and Identification in Cyber-Physical Systems-Part I: Models and Fundamental Limitations, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1202.6144; Antsaklis, P., Goals and challenges in cyber-physical systems research editorial of the editor in chief (2014) IEEE Transactions, Automatic Control on, 59 (12), pp. 3117-3119; Kumar Khaitan, S., McCalley, J.D., Design techniques and applications of cyber physical systems: A survey (2014) IEEE Systems Journal, pp. 350-352; Fawzi, H., Tabuada, P., Diggavi, S., Secure estimation and control for cyber-physical systems under adversarial attacks (2014) IEEE Transactions, Automatic Control on, 59 (6), pp. 1454-1467; Meskin, N., Khorasani, K., (2011) Fault Detection and Isolation: Multi-vehicle Unmanned Systems, , Springer Science Business Media; Edwards, C., Spurgeon, S.K., Patton, R.J., Sliding mode observers for fault detection and isolation (2000) Automatica, 36 (4), pp. 541-553; Mekki, H., Benzineb, O., Boukhetala, D., Tadjine, M., Benbouzid, M., Sliding mode based fault detection, reconstruction and fault tolerant control scheme for motor systems (2015) ISA Transactions; Alwi, H., Edwards, C., Pin Tan, C., (2011) Fault Detection and Fault-tolerant Control Using Sliding Modes, , Springer Science Business Media; Kosut, O., Jia, L., Thomas, R.J., Tong, L., Malicious data attacks on the smart grid (2011) Smart Grid, IEEE Transactions on, 2 (4), pp. 645-658; Kim, T.T., Vincent Poor, H., Strategic protection against data injection attacks on power grids (2011) IEEE Transactions, Smart Grid on, 2 (2), pp. 326-333; Mishra, S., Karamchandani, N., Tabuada, P., Diggavi, S., Secure state estimation and control using multiple (insecure) observers (2014) IEEE 53rd Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC), pp. 1620-1622; Shoukry, Y., Tabuada, P., Event-triggered projected Luenberger observer for linear systems under sparse sensor attacks (2014) IEEE 53rd Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC), pp. 3548-3549; Chong, M.S., Wakaiki, M., Hespanha, J.P., Observability of linear systems under adversarial attacks (2015) The Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE American Control Conference (ACC), pp. 2439-2440; Plestan, F., Shtessel, Y., Bregeault, V., Poznyak, A., New methodologies for adaptive sliding mode control (2010) International journal of control, 83 (9), pp. 1907-1919; Yucelen, T., Haddad, W.M., Feron, E.M., Adaptive control architectures for mitigating sensor attacks in cyber-physical systems (2016) Proc. of American Control Conference, , July; Astrom, K.J., Wittenmark, B., (2013) Adaptive Control, , Courier Corporation; Edwards, C., Spurgeon, S., (1998) Sliding Mode Control: Theory and Applications, , CRC Press; Rahme, S., Meskin, N., Adaptive sliding mode observer for sensor fault diagnosis of an industrial gas turbine (2015) Control Engineering Practice, 38, pp. 57-74; Ogata, K., (2001) Modern Control Engineering, , Prentice Hall PTR",,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2016 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, SMC 2016",9 October 2016 through 12 October 2016,,126403,,9.78151E+12,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Sharing data in a privacy-respecting manner could lead to important discoveries, but high-profile demonstrations show that links between de-identified genomic data and named persons can sometimes be reestablished. Such re-identification attacks have focused on worst-case scenarios and spurred the adoption of data-sharing practices that unnecessarily impede research. To mitigate concerns, organizations have traditionally relied upon legal deterrents, like data use agreements, and are considering suppressing or adding noise to genomic variants. In this report, we use a game theoretic lens to develop more effective, quantifiable protections for genomic data sharing. This is a fundamentally different approach because it accounts for adversarial behavior and capabilities and tailors protections to anticipated recipients with reasonable resources, not adversaries with unlimited means. We demonstrate this approach via a new public resource with genomic summary data from over 8,000 individuals—the Sequence and Phenotype Integration Exchange (SPHINX)—and show that risks can be balanced against utility more effectively than with traditional approaches. We further show the generalizability of this framework by applying it to other genomic data collection and sharing endeavors. Recognizing that such models are dependent on a variety of parameters, we perform extensive sensitivity analyses to show that our findings are robust to their fluctuations. © 2017 American Society of Human Genetics",adversarial modeling; Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network; game theory; genetic algorithm; genomic data privacy; genomic data sharing policy; re-identification risk; sensitivity analysis; Sequence and Phenotype Integration Exchange; summary statistics,"access to information; Article; genetic variation; genome; genomics; human; identity theft; information processing; noise; priority journal; privacy; single nucleotide polymorphism; electronic health record; genetic database; genetic privacy; information dissemination; legislation and jurisprudence; theoretical model; Databases, Genetic; Electronic Health Records; Genetic Privacy; Genomics; Humans; Information Dissemination; Models, Theoretical; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",,,,,"Schatz, M.C., Biological data sciences in genome research (2015) Genome Res., 25, pp. 1417-1422; Collins, F.S., Varmus, H., A new initiative on precision medicine (2015) N. Engl.

Hence we propose geography based Resource Constraint Secure routing (RCS) protocol. The existing routing protocol named Cost Aware SEcure Routing (CASER) allows messages to be transmitted using random walking routing strategy. In the Random walking method, there is a chance of choosing low energy node as a relay node. RCS protocol overcomes this by transmitting the data via energy aware route only and it provides authentication by using Modified ElGammal Signature (MES) scheme on Elliptic curve algorithm. For security purposes, the content of each message can also be encrypted by using a symmetric key encryption technique and decoded at the sink node by knowing the same secret key used by the source. So, unauthenticated person cannot access the original data. Therefore the protocol ensures a secure message delivery option to maximize the message delivery ratio under adversarial attacks. The performance evaluation results show that RCS performs better than CASER with respect to Packet Delivery Ratio, Energy Balance Factor and End-to-End Delay, Throughput and Routing overhead. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University.",Random walking; Routing; Security; Wireless sensor networks (WSN),,,,,,"Dargie, W., Poellabauer, C., (2010) Fundamentals of Wireless Sensor Networks: Theory and Practice, , Wiley; Hung, C.-C., Lin, K.C., Hsu, C.-C., Chou, C.-F., Tu, C.-J., On enhancing network- lifetime using opportunistic routing in wireless sensor networks (2010) 2010 Proceedings of 19th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN), pp. 1-6; Xu, W., Ma, K., Trappe, W., Zhang, Y., Jamming sensor networks: Attack and defense strategies (2006) IEEE Network, 20 (3), pp. 41-47; Cadger, F., Curran, K., Santos, J., Moffett, S., A survey of geographical routing in wireless ad-hoc networks (2013) IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 15 (2), pp. 621-653; Tang, D., Li, T., Ren, J., Wu, J., Cost-aware SEcure routing (CASER) protocol design for wireless sensor networks (2014) IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, 26 (4), pp. 960-973; Li, Y., Ren, J., Wu, J., Quantitative measurement and design of source-location privacy schemes for wireless sensor networks (2011) IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, 23 (7), pp. 1302-1311; Zakhary, S., Radenkovic, M., Benslimane, A., Efficient location privacy-aware forwarding in opportunistic mobile networks (2014) IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 63 (2), pp. 893-906; Pathan, A.S.K., Lee, H.-W., Hong, C.S., Security in wireless sensor networks: Issues and challenges (2006) Proceeding of the 8Th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology, 2, pp. 1043-1048; Zhang, H., Shen, H., Balancing energy consumption to maximize network lifetime in data-gathering sensor networks (2009) IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed.

By focusing on the problem of double JPEG compression, we first propose an improved universal counter-forensic (C-F) attack which works against any forensic detector based on the first order statistics of block-DCT coefficients and show its good performance against three different forensic detectors. Forensic detectors are commonly designed to distinguish between the absence and the presence of a given processing in a non-Adversarial environment. We emphasize how such an evaluation methodology is unfair as, in order to test the real effectiveness of an attack, the forensic detector should take into account the possible presence of the attack. Accordingly, we propose an adversary-Aware double JPEG detector which is trained to recognize the universal C-F attack. Experimental results confirm that the adversary-Aware detector yields good performance thus suggesting that developing an effective counter-forensic attack is much harder than one could expect. © 2016 IEEE.",,Adversarial environments; Counter-Forensics; Data-driven approach; Double JPEG compressions; Evaluation methodologies; First-order statistics; Forensic detection; Universal counter; Image compression,,,,,"Böhme, R., Kirchner, M., Counter-forensics: Attacking image forensics (2012) Digital Image Forensics, , H.

However, little attention has been paid to cooperation issues between patrolling agents. Moreover, most existing works focus on one-shot attacks and assume full rationality of the adversaries. Nonetheless, when patrolling frontiers, detecting illegal fishing or poaching; security forces face several adversaries with limited observability and rationality, that perform multiple illegal actions spread in time and space. In this paper, we develop a cooperative approach to improve defenders efficiency in such settings. We propose a new formalization of multiagent patrolling problems allowing for effective cooperation between the defenders. Our work accounts for uncertainty on action outcomes and partial observability of the system. Unlike existing security games, a generic model of the opponents is considered thus handling limited observability and bounded rationality of the adversaries. We then describe a learning mechanism allowing the defenders to take advantage of their observations about the adversaries and to compute cooperative patrolling strategies consequently. © 2016 IEEE.",,Artificial intelligence; Multi agent systems; Observability; Bounded rationality; Generic modeling; Illegal actions; Learning mechanism; Multi-agent patrolling; Partial observability; Security forces; Security games; Crime,,,,,"Jain, M., An, B., Tambe, M., An overview of recent application trends at the AAMAS conference: Security, sustainability and safety (2012) AI Magazine, 33 (3), pp. 14-28; Zhang, C., Sinha, A., Tambe, M., Keeping pace with criminals: Designing patrol allocation against adaptive opportunistic criminals (2015) Proceedings of the 2015 International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS'15), pp. 1351-1359; Agmon, N., Sadov, V., Kaminka, G.A., Kraus, S., The impact of adversarial knowledge on adversarial planning in perimeter patrol (2008) Proceedings of the 7th International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS'08), 1, pp. 55-62; Fang, F., Stone, P., Tambe, M., When security games go green: Designing defender strategies to prevent poaching and illegal fishing (2015) Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI'15); Shieh, E.A., Jiang, A.X., Yadav, A., Varakantham, P., Tambe, M., An extended study on addressing defender teamwork while accounting for uncertainty in attacker defender games using iterative DEC-MDPS (2016) Multiagent and Grid Systems, 11, pp. 189-226; Fang, F., Nguyen, T.H., Pickles, R., Lam, W.Y., Clements, G.R., An, B., Singh, A., Tambe, M., Deploying paws to combat poaching: Gametheoretic patrolling in areas with complex terrains (2016) Proceedings of the Thirtieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence; An, B., Brown, M., Vorobeychik, Y., Tambe, M., Security games with surveillance cost and optimal timing of attack execution (2013) Proceedings of the 2013 International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS'13), pp. 223-230; Paruchuri, P., Pearce, J.P., Tambe, M., Ordonez, F., Kraus, S., An efficient heuristic approach for security against multiple adversaries (2007) Proceedings of the 6th International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS'07), , 181:1-181:8; Basilico, N., Gatti, N., Amigoni, F., Leader-follower strategies for robotic patrolling in environments with arbitrary topologies (2009) Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS'09), 1, pp. 57-64; Kiekintveld, C., Jain, M., Tsai, J., Pita, J., Ordõnez, F., Tambe, M., Computing optimal randomized resource allocations for massive security games (2009) Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS'09), pp. 689-696; Agmon, N., Kraus, S., Kaminka, G.A., Sadov, V., Adversarial uncertainty in multi-robot patrol (2009) Proceedings of the 21st International Jont Conference on Artifical Intelligence (IJCAI'09), pp. 1811-1817; Nguyen, T.H., Sinha, A., Gholami, S., Plumptre, A., Joppa, L., Tambe, M., Driciru, M., Beale, C., Capture: A new predictive anti-poaching tool for wildlife protection (2016) 15th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS'16); Qian, Y., Haskell, W.B., Jiang, A.X., Tambe, M., Online planning for optimal protector strategies in resource conservation games (2014) Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS'14), pp. 733-740; Bernstein, D., Zilberstein, S., Immerman, N., The complexity of decentralized control of mdps (2002) Mathematics of Operations Research, 27 (4), pp. 819-840; Dibangoye, J., Amato, C., Buffet, O., Charpillet, F., Exploiting separability in multi-Agent planning with continuous-state MDPs (2014) Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS'14), pp. 1281-1288; Doshi, P., Gmytrasiewicz, P.J., A framework for sequential planning in multi-Agent settings (2011) Corr, , vol. abs/1109.2135; Jain, M., An, B., Tambe, M., An overview of recent application trends at the aamas conference: Security, sustainability and safety (2012) AI Magazine, 33 (3), pp. 14-28; Hadoux, E., Beynier, A., Weng, P., Solving hidden-semi-Markov- mode Markov decision problems (2014) Scalable Uncertainty Management, 8720, pp. 176-189. , ser.

In this paper, we propose an approach to threat assessment that fuses both game-Theoretic behavior modeling and adversarial intention recognition. In adversarial situations, where two opposing forces are competing to achieve conflicting goals in a shared environment, the behavior of the observed adversary will not only depend on the goal it is trying to achieve, but also on the decisions of its opponent. We model the planning process of such a goal-directed adversary as an Attack Stochastic Game and show how we can infer its intention by inverting this model. We evaluate the potential of our approach for early and accurate intention recognition on an illustrative scenario where a decision maker has to defend a set of valuable assets against an attacker, and we discuss planned extensions. © 2016 IEEE.",,Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Inverse problems; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Decision makers; Game-theoretic; High-level information fusion; Intention recognition; Planning process; Situational awareness; Stochastic game; Threat assessment; Game theory,,,,,"Steinberg, A.N., Foundations of situation and threat assessment (2008) Handbook of Multisensor Data Fusion: Theory And, practice, pp. 437-501; Avrahami-Zilberbrand, D., Kaminka, G.A., Keyhole adversarial plan recognition for recognition of suspicious and anomalous behavior (2014) Plan, Activity, and Intent Recognition Theory and Practice, 1, pp. 87-119. , Elsevier; Wallenius, K., Support for situation awareness in command and control (2004) Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION 2004), 2, pp. 1117-1124; Baker, C.L., Tenenbaum, J.B., Saxe, R.R., Goal inference as inverse planning (2007) Proceedings of the 29th Annual, meeting of the Cognitive Science Society; Ramirez, M., Geffner, H., Goal recognition over POMDPs: Inferring the intention of a POMDP agent (2011) IJCAI, pp. 2009-2014; Geib, C.W., Goldman, R.P., Probabilistic plan recognition for hostile agents (2001) FLAIRS Conference, pp. 580-584; Qin, X., Lee, W., Attack plan recognition and prediction using causal networks (2004) 20th Annual Computer Security, Applications Conference, pp. 370-379. , IEEE; Li, L., Wang, D.-Y., Wang, Y., Gu, W.-X., An approach to the misleading action solving in plan recognition (2012) International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, 4, pp. 1285-1289. , IEEE; Braynov, S., Adversarial planning and plan recognition: Two sides of the same coin (2006) Secure Knowledge, Management Workshop; Lisy, V., Píbil, R., Stiborek, J., Bosansky, B., Pechoucek, M., Gametheoretic approach to adversarial plan, recognition (2012) ECAI, pp. 546-551; Ramirez, M., Geffner, H., Plan recognition as planning (2009) Proceedings of the 21st International Joint Conference on Artifical Intelligence, pp. 1778-1783. , Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc; Ramirez, M., Geffner, H., Probabilistic plan recognition using off-The-shelf classical planners (2010) Proceedings of the Conference of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2010); Pattison, D., Long, D., Accurately determining intermediate and terminal plan states using Bayesian goal, recognition (2011) ICAPS; E-Martín, Y., R-Moreno, M.D., Smith, D.E., A fast goal recognition technique based on interaction estimates (2015) Twenty-Fourth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence; Pereira, R.F., Meneguzzi, F., (2016) Landmark-based Plan Recognition, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1604.01277; Ullman, T., Baker, C., Macindoe, O., Evans, O., Goodman, N., Tenenbaum, J.B., Help or hinder: Bayesian models of social goal inference (2009) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 1874-1882; Ramírez, M., (2012) Plan Recognition as Planning, , Ph.D. dissertation, Universitat Pompeu Fabra; Diuk, C., Cohen, A., Littman, M.L., An object-oriented representation for efficient reinforcement learning (2008) Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 240-247. , ACM; Shapley, L.S., Stochastic games (1953) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 39 (10), p. 1095; Sheyner, O.M., (2004) Scenario Graphs and Attack Graphs, , Ph.D. dissertation, US Air Force Research Laboratory; Jha, S., Sheyner, O., Wing, J., Two formal analyses of attack graphs (2002) Computer Security Foundations Workshop, 2002.

However, transitioning from centralized to decentralized environment creates various new set of problems, such as adversarial manipulations. In this paper, we present DLSAS, a novel unsupervised and decentralized anti-spam framework for DOSNs. DLSAS provides decentralized spam detection that is resilient to adversarial attacks. DLSAS typifies massively parallel frameworks and exploits fully decentralized learning and cooperative approaches. Furthermore, DLSAS provides a novel defense mechanism for DOSNs to prevent malicious nodes participating in the system by creating a validation overlay to asses the credibility of the exchanged information among the participating nodes and exclude the misbehaving nodes from the system. Extensive experiments using Twitter datasets confirm not only the DLSAS's capability to detect spam with higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches, but also the DLSAS's robustness against different adversarial attacks. © 2016 IEEE.",Decentralized online social networks; Distributed systems; Spam detection; System integrity and robustness,Online systems; Websites; Decentralized learning; Distributed systems; Massively parallels; On-line social networks; Open source communities; Spam detection; State-of-the-art approach; System integrity; Social networking (online),,,,,"Jahid, S., Nilizadeh, S., Mittal, P., Borisov, N., Kapadia, A., Decent: A decentralized architecture for enforcing privacy in online social networks (2012) PERCOM'12.

They often transfer from one model to another, allowing attackers to mount black box attacks without knowledge of the target model's parameters. Adversarial training is the process of explicitly training a model on adversarial examples, in order to make it more robust to attack or to reduce its test error on clean inputs. So far, adversarial training has primarily been applied to small problems. In this research, we apply adversarial training to ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2014). Our contributions include: (1) recommendations for how to succes-fully scale adversarial training to large models and datasets, (2) the observation that adversarial training confers robustness to single-step attack methods, (3) the finding that multi-step attack methods are somewhat less transferable than single-step attack methods, so single-step attacks are the best for mounting black-box attacks, and (4) resolution of a “label leaking” effect that causes adversarially trained models to perform better on adversarial examples than on clean examples, because the adversarial example construction process uses the true label and the model can learn to exploit regularities in the construction process. © ICLR 2019 - Conference Track Proceedings.

These transferable adversarial examples may severely hinder deep neural network-based applications. Previous works mostly study the transferability using small scale datasets. In this work, we are the first to conduct an extensive study of the transferability over large models and a large scale dataset, and we are also the first to study the transferability of targeted adversarial examples with their target labels. We study both non-targeted and targeted adversarial examples, and show that while transferable non-targeted adversarial examples are easy to find, targeted adversarial examples generated using existing approaches almost never transfer with their target labels. Therefore, we propose novel ensemble-based approaches to generating transferable adversarial examples. Using such approaches, we observe a large proportion of targeted adversarial examples that are able to transfer with their target labels for the first time. We also present some geometric studies to help understanding the transferable adversarial examples. Finally, we show that the adversarial examples generated using ensemble-based approaches can successfully attack Clarifai.com, which is a black-box image classification system. © ICLR 2019 - Conference Track Proceedings.

However, it was discovered that machine learning models, including the best performing DNNs, suffer from a fundamental problem: they can unexpectedly and confidently misclassify examples formed by slightly perturbing otherwise correctly recognized inputs. Various approaches have been developed for efficiently generating these so-called adversarial examples, but those mostly rely on ascending the gradient of loss. In this paper, we introduce the novel logits optimized targeting system (LOTS) to directly manipulate deep features captured at the penultimate layer. Using LOTS, we analyze and compare the adversarial robustness of DNNs using the traditional Softmax layer with Openmax, which was designed to provide open set recognition by defining classes derived from deep representations, and is claimed to be more robust to adversarial perturbations. We demonstrate that Openmax provides less vulnerable systems than Softmax to traditional attacks, however, we show that it can be equally susceptible to more sophisticated adversarial generation techniques that directly work on deep representations. © 2017.

It is also observed that these perturbations generalize across multiple networks trained on the same target data. However, these algorithms require training data on which the CNNs were trained and compute adversarial perturbations via complex optimization. The fooling performance of these approaches is directly proportional to the amount of available training data. This makes them unsuitable for practical attacks since its unreasonable for an attacker to have access to the training data. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a novel data independent approach to generate image agnostic perturbations for a range of CNNs trained for object recognition. We further show that these perturbations are transferable across multiple network architectures trained either on same or different data. In the absence of data, our method generates universal perturbations efficiently via fooling the features learned at multiple layers thereby causing CNNs to misclassify. Experiments demonstrate impressive fooling rates and surprising transferability for the proposed universal perturbations generated without any training data. © 2017.

However, it remains vulnerable against adversarial perturbations of the input that have been crafted specifically to fool the system while being quasi-imperceptible to a human. In this work, we propose to augment deep neural networks with a small “detector” subnetwork which is trained on the binary classification task of distinguishing genuine data from data containing adversarial perturbations. Our method is orthogonal to prior work on addressing adversarial perturbations, which has mostly focused on making the classification network itself more robust. We show empirically that adversarial perturbations can be detected surprisingly well even though they are quasi-imperceptible to humans. Moreover, while the detectors have been trained to detect only a specific adversary, they generalize to similar and weaker adversaries. In addition, we propose an adversarial attack that fools both the classifier and the detector and a novel training procedure for the detector that counteracts this attack. © ICLR 2019 - Conference Track Proceedings.

Successful rollback attacks have serious consequences on applications such as financial services. In this paper, we propose a new approach for rollback protection on SGX. The intuition behind our approach is simple. A single platform cannot efficiently prevent rollback, but in many practical scenarios, multiple processors can be enrolled to assist each other. We design and implement a rollback protection system called ROTE that realizes integrity protection as a distributed system. We construct a model that captures adversarial ability to schedule enclave execution and show that our solution achieves a strong security property: the only way to violate integrity is to reset all participating platforms to their initial state. We implement ROTE and demonstrate that distributed rollback protection can provide significantly better performance than previously known solutions based on local non-volatile memory. © 2017 by The USENIX Association.

To date, these tools have encountered little adversarial pressure. This paper evaluates the robustness of such tools if (or when) adversarial attacks manifest. We demonstrate, for the first time, the synthesis of DNA which — when sequenced and processed — gives an attacker arbitrary remote code execution. To study the feasibility of creating and synthesizing a DNA-based exploit, we performed our attack on a modified downstream sequencing utility with a deliberately introduced vulnerability. After sequencing, we observed information leakage in our data due to sample bleeding. While this phenomena is known to the sequencing community, we provide the first discussion of how this leakage channel could be used adversarially to inject data or reveal sensitive information. We then evaluate the general security hygiene of common DNA processing programs, and unfortunately, find concrete evidence of poor security practices used throughout the field. Informed by our experiments and results, we develop a broad framework and guidelines to safeguard security and privacy in DNA synthesis, sequencing, and processing. © 2017 by The USENIX Association.

We address this problem with Cloak, a new technique that uses hardware transactional memory to prevent adversarial observation of cache misses on sensitive code and data. We show that Cloak provides strong protection against all known cache-based side-channel attacks with low performance overhead. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by retrofitting vulnerable code with Cloak and experimentally confirming immunity against state-of-the-art attacks. We also show that by applying Cloak to code running inside Intel SGX enclaves we can effectively block information leakage through cache side channels from enclaves, thus addressing one of the main weaknesses of SGX. © 2017 by The USENIX Association.

I find in Living My Life two approaches to antiauthoritarian action: Adversarial politics seeks to emancipate the masses by contesting the agents of state, market, or patriarchy, but it falters when radicals act for those with whom they share few experiences. Empathetic politics builds that needed solidarity, by encouraging radicals to learn from the masses and by educating the masses on the conditions that motivate radicals to act. I follow Goldman’s transition between these approaches through narratives of early life and politics, prison, nursing, and her assistance with Alexander Berkman’s attack on Henry Clay Frick and her defense of William McKinley’s assassin. Living My Life proposes that radicals summon the people through shared experience, expanding our understanding of radical thought and the relevance of autobiography for political theory. © 2017 by The Jack Miller Center.

According to the demonstration website, the API 'quickly classifies images into thousands of categories, detects individual objects and faces within images, and finds and reads printed words contained within images.' It can be also used to 'detect different types of inappropriate content from adult to violent content.' In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of Google Cloud Vision API to input perturbation. In particular, we show that by adding sufficient noise to the image, the API generates completely different outputs for the noisy image, while a human observer would perceive its original content. We show that the attack is consistently successful, by performing extensive experiments on different image types, including natural images, images containing faces and images with texts. For instance, using images from ImageNet dataset, we found that adding an average of 14.25% impulse noise is enough to deceive the API. Our findings indicate the vulnerability of the API in adversarial environments. For example, an adversary can bypass an image filtering system by adding noise to inappropriate images. We then show that when a noise filter is applied on input images, the API generates mostly the same outputs for restored images as for original images. This observation suggests that cloud vision API can readily benefit from noise filtering, without the need for updating image analysis algorithms. © 2017 IEEE.",Adversarial machine learning; Google Cloud Vision API; Image Noise; Machine learning,Impulse noise; Learning systems; Object detection; Web services; Adversarial environments; Google Cloud Vision API; Human observers; Image analysis algorithms; Image noise; Individual objects; Input perturbation; Original images; Machine learning,,,,,"Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G.E., Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (2012) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 1097-1105; Simonyan, K., Zisserman, A., (2014) Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-scale Image Recognition; Lee, C.-Y., Xie, S., Gallagher, P.W., Zhang, Z., Tu, Z., Deeplysupervised nets (2015) AISTATS, 2, p. 5; https://cloud.google.com/vision/; Huang, L., Joseph, A.D., Nelson, B., Rubinstein, B.I., Tygar, J., Adversarial machine learning (2011) Proceedings of the 4th ACM Workshop on Security and Artificial Intelligence, pp. 43-58. , ACM; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Jha, S., Fredrikson, M., Celik, Z.B., Swami, A., The limitations of deep learning in adversarial settings (2016) Security and Privacy (EuroS&P), 2016 IEEE European Symposium on, pp. 372-387. , IEEE; Amodei, D., Olah, C., Steinhardt, J., Christiano, P., Schulman, J., Mané, D., (2016) Concrete Problems in Ai Safety; Carlini, N., Mishra, P., Vaidya, T., Zhang, Y., Sherr, M., Shields, C., Wagner, D., Zhou, W., Hidden voice commands (2016) 25th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 16), , Austin, TX; Sharif, M., Bhagavatula, S., Bauer, L., Reiter, M.K., Accessorize to a crime: Real and stealthy attacks on state-of-The-Art face recognition (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 1528-1540. , ACM; Hosseini, H., Kannan, S., Zhang, B., Poovendran, R., (2017) Deceiving Google's Perspective Api Built for Detecting Toxic Comments; Hosseini, H., Xiao, B., Poovendran, R., (2017) Deceiving Google's Cloud Video Intelligence Api Built for Summarizing Videos; Röhrbein, F., Goddard, P., Schneider, M., James, G., Guo, K., How does image noise affect actual and predicted human gaze allocation in assessing image quality?

They note that uncertainties can arise from: (1) statistical variations (e.g., “random error in direct measurements of a quantity”); (2) systematic errors (e.g., “biases in the measuring apparatus and experimental procedure”); (3) subjective judgments (e.g., for quantities where empirical data are largely unavailable); (4) linguistic imprecision (e.g., translation of verbal phrases into numerical probabilities); (5) variability (e.g., quantities that vary over time or space, or from one person to another); (6) inherent randomness or unpredictability (which cannot be reduced by further research); (7) disagreement (e.g., among multiple experts); (8) approximation (e.g., due to limits in the spatial resolution of a model); and (9) model uncertainty (i.e., uncertainty about the most appropriate model to represent some phenomenon). In the context of terrorism risk, statistical variation might arise from the sparseness of data on actual terrorist attacks; systematic error could reflect the fact that many terrorist plots are likely to go unobserved; and uncertainty about the most appropriate model (e.g., game theory vs. decision theory vs. risk analysis) is likely to be widespread. Even within a single model, experts may disagree about the relative importance of different terrorist objectives (e.g., fatalities vs. economic damage). These importance weights might also vary over time, and from one terrorist group to another. Thus, good strategies for dealing with uncertainty – both statistical methods for drawing reliable conclusions from sparse data sets (e.g., about whether the frequency or severity of terrorist events is increasing over time; Mohtadi and Murshid 2009), and also methods for dealing with “deep uncertainty” (e.g., about whether terrorist groups are optimizing vs. satisficing; Shan and Zhuang 2013) – are crucially important. Predicting where and when a terrorist or other adversary is likely to strike invites speculation about a host of unknowns. What do adversaries care about, and how do they assess their chances of success? What are their priorities? What deters them? Are attackers who perceive their cause as righteous, just, or holy also more likely to believe that their attacks will succeed? How can defenders best prepare to defend against adversarial attacks when the answers to some or all of these questions are unknown? (In terms of the taxonomy by Morgan and Henrion, such questions are concerned with disagreement and model uncertainty.) © Cambridge University Press 2017.",,,,,,,"Asbeck, E., Haimes, Y.Y., The partitioned multiobjective risk method (1984) Large Scale Systems, 6, pp. 13-38; Ball, D.J., Watt, J., Further thoughts on the utility of risk matrices (2013) Risk Analysis, 33, pp. 2068-2078; Bier, V.M., Some illustrative examples of model uncertainty (1993) Proceedings of Workshop I in Advanced Topics in Risk and Reliability Analysis, Model Uncertainty: Its Characterization and Quantification, pp. 91-98. , October 20-22)., Annapolis, Maryland.

These digital components fill a gap with legacy equipment where replacement components no longer exist. They also benefit operation of the plant by increasing efficiency in power generation, monitoring of equipment and plant parameters, as well as aiding operator control. However, the addition of digital components and systems also adds cyber risks with previously unanalyzed failure modes and attack vectors are introduced with these new systems. These risks are difficult to identify, analyze, and mitigate due to the increasingly complex nature of the digital components and the integration of these components with additional plant processes and communication networks. The research presented in this paper develops a new method that addresses the cyber risk to inform appropriate levels of protection. EPRI and Sandia are working under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement to develop an effective method of evaluating the cyber risk in production nuclear power facilities. The Cyber Hazards Analysis Risk Methodology (CHARM) focuses on ensuring adequate controls are in place for appropriate cyber protection of the plant from radiological release or generation risk. Existing plant hazards analyses (e.g., PRA, FTA) do not account for software deficiencies or adversarial intent. This method leverages existing plant analyses and MIT’s Systems Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) to create cyber informed fault trees. These new fault trees will provide the basis for comprehensive cyber risk analysis and help ensure potential gaps in cyber security controls are identified and corrected.

This raises concerns that such classifiers are vulnerable to attacks and calls into question their usage in safety-critical systems. We show in this paper for the first time formal guarantees on the robustness of a classifier by giving instance-specific lower bounds on the norm of the input manipulation required to change the classifier decision. Based on this analysis we propose the Cross-Lipschitz regularization functional. We show that using this form of regularization in kernel methods resp. neural networks improves the robustness of the classifier with no or small loss in prediction performance. © 2017 Neural information processing systems foundation.

So far, most existing methods only work for classification and are not designed to alter the true performance measure of the problem at hand. We introduce a novel flexible approach named Houdini for generating adversarial examples specifically tailored for the final performance measure of the task considered, be it combinatorial and non-decomposable. We successfully apply Houdini to a range of applications such as speech recognition, pose estimation and semantic segmentation. In all cases, the attacks based on Houdini achieve higher success rate than those based on the traditional surrogates used to train the models while using a less perceptible adversarial perturbation. © 2017 Neural information processing systems foundation.

We focus on the strategic selection of various honeypot configurations in order to adapt to an intelligent attacker amidst a dynamic environment. In order to infiltrate networks, attackers leverage various exploits on the system. However, these exploits and the value they provide dynamically change over time as more information is gathered about them. We intro-duce a model that addresses the combinatorial complexity of the honeypot selection problem and allow for these dynamic exploits. To solve this new problem, we map this model to a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem, which is a class of machine learning problems that maintain balance between exploration and exploitation. We show empirically that both stochastic and adversarial MAB solutions improve over static defense strategies. © Copyright 2017, International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

In recent years, many investigations have been made. However, they are not sufficient. To improve the comprehensiveness of prediction, in this paper, we quantitatively convert attack threat into security situation. Actually, two algorithms are proposed, namely, attack prediction algorithm using dynamic Bayesian attack graph and security situation quantification algorithm based on attack prediction. The first algorithm aims to provide more abundant information of future attack behaviors by simulating incremental network penetration. Through timely evaluating the attack capacity of intruder and defense strategies of defender, the likely attack goal, path, and probability and time-cost are predicted dynamically along with the ongoing security events. Furthermore, in combination with the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) metric and network assets information, the second algorithm quantifies the concealed attack threat into the surfaced security risk from two levels: Host and network. Examples show that our method is feasible and flexible for the attack-defense adversarial network environment, which benefits the administrator to infer the security situation in advance and prerepair the critical compromised hosts to maintain normal network communication. © 2017 Hao Hu et al.",,Forecasting; Adversarial networks; Common vulnerability scoring systems; Incremental networks; Network administrator; Network communications; Network security situations; Quantitative method; Security situation; Network security,,,,,"Fava, D.S., Byers, S.R., Yang, S.J., Projecting cyberattacks through variable-length Markov models (2008) IEEE Transactions On Information Forensics and Security, 3 (3), pp. 359-369; Yang, S.J., Byers, S., Holsopple, J., Argauer, B., Fava, D., Intrusion activity projection for cyber situational awareness (2008) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference On Intelligence and Security Informatics (IEEE ISI '08), pp. 167-172. , June; Hao, Y.-H., Han, J.-H., Lin, Y., Liu, L., Vulnerabilityof complex networks under three-level-tree attacks (2016) Physica A.

The continuous change in the way attacks are appearing, the volume of attacks, as well as the improvements in the big data analytics space, make machine learning approaches more alluringthan ever. The intention of this paper is to show that using machine learning in the intrusion detection domain should be accompanied with an evaluation of its robustness against adversaries. Several adversarial techniques have emerged lately from the deep learning research, largely in the area of image classification. These techniques are based on the idea of introducing small changes in the original input data in order to make a machine learning model to misclassify it. This paper follows a big data analytics methodology and explores adversarial machine learning techniques that have emerged from the deep learning domain, against machine learning classifiers used for network intrusion detection. We look at several well-known classifiers and study their performance under attack over several metrics, such as accuracy, F1-score and receiver operating characteristic. The approach used assumes no knowledge of the original classifier and examines both general and targeted misclassification. The results showthat using relatively simple methods for generating adversarial samples it is possible to lower the detection accuracy of intrusion detection classifiers as much as 27%. Performance degradation is achieved using a methodology that is simpler than previous approaches and it requires only 6.14% change between the original and the adversarial sample, making it a candidate for a practical adversarial approach. © 2017 CEUR-WS.

However, such enclaved execution environments are known to be vulnerable to a powerful class of controlled-channel attacks. Recent research convincingly demonstrated that adversarial system software can extract sensitive data from enclaved applications by carefully revoking access rights on enclave pages, and recording the associated page faults. As a response, a number of state-of-the-art defense techniques has been proposed that suppress page faults during enclave execution. This paper shows, however, that page table-based threats go beyond page faults. We demonstrate that an untrusted operating system can observe enclave page accesses without resorting to page faults, by exploiting other side-effects of the address translation process. We contribute two novel attack vectors that infer enclaved memory accesses from page table attributes, as well as from the caching behavior of unprotected page table memory. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks by recovering EdDSA session keys with little to no noise from the popular Libgcrypt cryptographic software suite. © 2017 by The USENIX Association.

Recently, a strongly unforgeable certificateless signature (CLS) scheme without random oracles was presented. In this paper, we firstly show that the scheme fails to achieve strong unforgeability by forging a new signature on a previously signed message under its adversarial model. Then, we point out that the scheme is also vulnerable to the malicious-but-passive key generation center (MKGC) attacks. Finally, we propose an improved strongly unforgeable CLS scheme in the standard model. The improved scheme not only meets the requirement of strong unforgeability but also withstands the MKGC attacks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to prove a CLS scheme to be strongly unforgeable against the MKGC attacks without using random oracles. © 2017 Wenjie Yang et al.",,Information systems;

All model classes of machine learning systems can be misled by providing carefully crafted inputs making them wrongly classify inputs. Maliciously created input samples can affect the learning process of a ML system by either slowing the learning process, or affecting the performance of the learned model or causing the system make error only in attacker’s planned scenario. Because of these developments, understanding security of machine learning algorithms and systems is emerging as an important research area among computer security and machine learning researchers and practitioners. We present a survey of this emerging area named Adversarial machine learning. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Adversarial learning; Computer security; Intrusion detection,Artificial intelligence; Big data; Intrusion detection; Investments; Learning systems; Malware; Mercury (metal); Security of data; Security systems; Adversarial learning; Autonomous Vehicles; Investment decisions; Learning process; Machine learning models; Network intrusions; Recent researches; Security surveillance; Learning algorithms,,,,,"Szegedy, C., Zaremba, W., Sutskever, I., Bruna, J., Erhan, D., Goodfellow, I., Fergus, R., Intriguing Properties of Neural Networks, , https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6199v4.pdf; Tramer, F., Zhang, F., Juels, A., Reiter, M.K., Ristenpart, T., (2016) Stealing Machine Learning Models via Prediction Apis, , USENIX Security Symposium; (2016) Microsoft’s AI Twitter Bot Goes Dark after Racist, Sexist Tweets, , http://www.reuters.com/article/us-microsoft-twitter-bot-idUSKCN0WQ2LA, 24 March; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Goodfellow, I., Jha, S., Celik, Z.B., Swami, A., Practical black-box attacks against machine learning (2017) In: ACM Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ASIACCS), April; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Goodfellow, I., Transferability in Machine Learning: From Phenomena to Black-Box Attacks Using Adversarial Samples, , https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.07277.pdf; Goodfellow, I., Shlens, J., Szegedy, C., Explaining and harnessing adversarial examples (2015) In: International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR); Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Jha, S., Fredrikson, M., Celik, Z.B., Swami, A., The limitations of deep learning in adversarial settings (2016) IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (Euro S&P); Goodfellow, I., Pouget-Abadie, J., Mirza, M., Xu, B., Warde-Farley, D., Ozair, S., Courville, A., Bengio Y.: Generative Adversarial Networks., , https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf; Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Wu, X., Jha, S., Swami, A., Distillation as a defense to adversarial perturbations against deep neural networks (2016) IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP); Hinton, G., Vinyals, O., Dean, J., Distilling the knowledge in a neural network (2014) Deep Learning and Representation Learning Workshop at NIPS, , https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.02531.pdf; Liang, B., Li, H., Su, M., Bian, M., Li, X., Shi, W., Deep Text Classification Can Be Fooled, , https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08006; Moosavi-Dezfooli, S.-M., Fawzi, A., Frossard, P., DeepFool: A simple and accurate method to fool deep neural networks (2016) Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","Kumar, A.; IBM Research, G2 Block, 8th Fl., Manyata Tech Park, Ngawara, India; 电子邮件: kumar.atul@in.ibm.com",Sureka A.Chakravarthy S.Reddy P.K.Bhalla S.,,Springer Verlag,"5th International Conference on Big Data Analytics, BDA 2017",12 December 2017 through 15 December 2017,,208319,3029743,9.78332E+12,,,English,Lect.

The various cryptographic primitives are designed concretely following some randomization design strategies, so that one of the goals is to make it hard for the attacker to distinguish between the real ciphers and the randomly distributed ones. Recently, Google Brain team proposed the idea to build cryptographic scheme automatically based on the neural network, and they claim that the scheme can defeat neural network adversaries. While it is a whole new direction, the security of the underlined scheme is remained unknown. In this paper, we investigate their basic statistical behavior from traditional cryptography’s point of view and extend their original scheme to discuss how the encryption protocol behave under a much more stronger adversary. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",,Security of data; Security systems; Cryptographic primitives; Cryptographic schemes; Design strategies; Encryption protocols; Encryption schemes; Randomly distributed; Statistical behavior; Cryptography,,,,,"Abadi, M., Agarwal, A., Barham, P., Brevdo, E., Chen, Z., Citro, C., Corrado, G.S., Devin, M., (2016) Tensorflow: Large-Scale Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Distributed Systems; Abadi, M., Andersen, D.G., (2016) Learning to Protect Communications with Adversarial Neural Cryptography; Goldwasser, S., Micali, S., Probabilistic encryption (1984) J.

We focus on the broad class of computational assumptions which we call target assumptions where the adversary’s goal is to compute concrete group elements. Our analysis identifies two families of intractability assumptions, the q-Generalized Diffie-Hellman Exponent (q-GDHE) assumptions and the q-Simple Fractional (q-SFrac) assumptions (a natural generalization of the q-SDH assumption), that imply all other target assumptions. These two assumptions therefore serve as Uber assumptions that can underpin all the target assumptions where the adversary has to compute specific group elements. We also study the internal hierarchy among members of these two assumption families. We provide heuristic evidence that both families are necessary to cover the full class of target assumptions. We also prove that having (polynomially many times) access to an adversarial 1-GDHE oracle, which returns correct solutions with non-negligible probability, entails one to solve any instance of the Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption. This proves equivalence between the CDH and 1-GDHE assumptions. The latter result is of independent interest. We generalize our results to the bilinear group setting. For the base groups, our results translate nicely and a similar structure of non-interactive computational assumptions emerges. We also identify Uber assumptions in the target group but this requires replacing the q-GDHE assumption with a more complicated assumption, which we call the bilinar gap assumption. Our analysis can assist both cryptanalysts and cryptographers. For cryptanalysts, we propose the q-GDHE and the q-SDH assumptions are the most natural and important targets for cryptanalysis in prime-order groups. For cryptographers, we believe our classification can aid the choice of assumptions underpinning cryptographic schemes and be used as a guide to minimize the overall attack surface that different assumptions expose. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2017.",,Computation theory; Security of data; Bilinear groups; Computational assumptions; Correct solution; Cryptographic schemes; Diffie Hellman; Natural generalization; Prime orders; Target group; Cryptography,,,,,"Abdalla, M., Benhamouda, F., Passelègue, A., An algebraic framework for pseudorandom functions and applications to related-key security (2015) CRYPTO 2015.

However, as with most machine learning methods, these networks suffer from the data imbalance problem - when the underlying training dataset is comprised of an unequal number of samples for each label/class. Such imbalance enforces a phenomena known as domain shift that causes the model to have poor generalisation when presented with previously unseen data. Recent research has focused on a technique called gradient sign that intensifies domain shift in CNNs by modifying inputs to deliberately yield erroneous model outputs, while appearing unmodified to human observers. Several commercial systems rely on image recognition techniques to perform well. Therefore, adversarial attacks poses serious threats to their integrity. In this work we present an experimental study that sheds light on the link between adversarial attacks, imbalanced learning and transfer learning. Through a series of experiments we evaluate the fast gradient sign method on class imbalanced CNNs, linking model vulnerabilities to the characteristics of its underlying training set and internal model knowledge. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Adversarial examples; Convolutional neural networks; Gradient sign; Imbalanced training; Transfer learning,Image recognition; Learning systems; Neural networks; Adversarial examples; Commercial systems; Convolutional neural network; Imbalanced Learning; Internal modeling; Machine learning methods; Recent researches; Transfer learning; Convolution,,,,,"Barua, S., Islam, M.M., Murase, K., A novel synthetic minority oversampling technique for imbalanced data set learning (2011) ICONIP 2011, Part II.

Automatic classification of malicious software is efficient because it does not need to store all characteristic. In this paper, we propose a transferred generative adversarial network (tGAN) for automatic classification and detection of the zero-day attack. Since the GAN is unstable in training process, often resulting in generator that produces nonsensical outputs, a method to pre-train GAN with autoencoder structure is proposed. We analyze the detector, and the performance of the detector is visualized by observing the clustering pattern of malicious software using t-SNE algorithm. The proposed model gets the best performance compared with the conventional machine learning algorithms. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Autoencoder; Generative adversarial network; Malicious software; Transfer learning; Zero-day attack,Computer crime; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Adversarial networks; Auto encoders; Automatic classification; Conventional machines; Malware detection; Training process; Transfer learning; Zero day attack; Malware,,,,,"Dhammi, A., Singh, M., Behavior analysis of malware using machine learning (2015) IEEE International Conference on Contemporery Computing, pp. 481-486; Christodorescum, M., Jha, S., Seshia, S.A., Song, D., Bryant, R.E., Semantics-aware malware detection (2005) Security and Privacy, pp. 32-46; Nataraj, L., Karthikeyanm, S., Jacob, G., Manjunath, B.S., Malware images: Visualization and automatic classification (2011) Proceedings of the Conference on Visualizing for Cyber Security, p. 4; Kong, D., Guanhua, Y., Discriminant malware distance learning on structural information for automated malware classification (2013) Proceedings of the Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Datamining, pp. 1357-1365; Pascanu, R., Stokes, J.W., Sanossian, H., Marinescu, M., Thomas, A., Malware classification with recurrent network (2015) Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, pp. 1916-1920; Akritidis, P., Kostas, A., Evangelos, M.P., Efficient content-based detection of zero-day worms (2005) Communications, 2, pp. 837-843; Grace, M., Zhou, Y., Zhang, Q., Zou, S., Jiang, X., RiskRanker: Scalable and accurate zero-day android malware detection (2012) Proceedings of the Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services, pp. 281-294; Goodfellow, I., Pouget-Abadie, J., Mirze, M., Xu, B., Warde-Farley, D., Ozair, S., Courville, A., Bengio, Y., Generative adversarial nets (2014) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 2672-2680; Radford, A., Luke, M., Soumith, C., (2015) Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks; Bourlard, H., Yves, K., Auto-association by multilayer perceptrons and singular value decomposition (1988) Biol.

To protect legitimate users from the evolving Android malware attacks, systems using machine learning techniques have been successfully deployed and offer unparalleled flexibility in automatic Android malware detection. Unfortunately, as machine learning based classifiers become more widely deployed, the incentive for defeating them increases. In this paper, we explore the security of machine learning in Android malware detection on the basis of a learning-based classifier with the input of Application Programming Interface (API) calls extracted from the smali files. In particular, we consider different levels of the attackers’ capability and present a set of corresponding evasion attacks to thoroughly assess the security of the classifier. To effectively counter these evasion attacks, we then propose a robust secure-learning paradigm and show that it can improve system security against a wide class of evasion attacks. The proposed model can also be readily applied to other security tasks, such as anti-spam and fraud detection. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Adversarial machine learning; Android malware detection; Evasion attack,Android (operating system); Application programming interfaces (API); Artificial intelligence; Big data; Computer crime; Damage detection; Explosives detection; Information management; Learning systems; Malware; Smartphones; Space division multiple access; Android malware; Evasion attack; Explosive growth; Fraud detection; Learning paradigms; Legitimate users; Machine learning models; Machine learning techniques; Mobile security,,,,,"Ios Combine for 91 Percent of Market, , http://www.cnet.com; http://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., Can machine learning be secure?

Since cyberattacks are getting easier to run, they are also becoming more serious threats from the economic damage perspective. Consequently, we are evident of a continuous adversarial relationship between the attackers trying to mount as powerful as possible attacks and defenders trying to stop the attackers in their goals. To defend against such attacks, defenders have at their disposal a plethora of techniques but they are often falling behind the attackers due to the fact that they need to protect the whole system while the attacker needs to find only a single weakness to exploit. In this paper, we consider one type of a cyberattack – network intrusion – and investigate how to use feature construction via genetic programming in order to improve the intrusion detection accuracy. The obtained results show that feature construction offers improvements in a number of tested scenarios and therefore should be considered as an important step in defense efforts. Such improvements are especially apparent in scenario with the highly unbalanced data, which also represents the most interesting case from the defensive perspective. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,Feature extraction; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Mercury (metal); Neonatal monitoring; Cyber threats; Cyber-attacks; Cyberspaces; Economic damages; Feature construction; Network intrusion detection; Network intrusions; Unbalanced data; Intrusion detection,,,,,"Browne, R., (2017) Nato: We Ward off 500 Cyberattacks Each Month, , http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/19/politics/nato-500-cyberattacks-monthly/; (2017), https://www.symantec.com/securityresponse/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-051310-3522-99; Fratantonio, Y., Qian, C., Chung, S., Lee, W., (2017) Cloak and Dagger: From Two Permissions to Complete Control of the UI Feedback Loop, May. , Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, Oakland, San Jose, CA; García-Teodoro, P., Díaz-Verdejo, J., Maciá-Fernández, G., Vázquez, E., Anomaly-based network intrusion detection: Techniques (2009) Syst.

[1] studied the notion of bitwise p-tampering attacks over randomized algorithms in which an efficient ‘virus’ gets to control each bit of the randomness with independent probability p in an online way. The work of [1] showed how to break certain ‘privacy primitives’ (e.g., encryption, commitments, etc.) through bitwise p-tampering, by giving a bitwise p-tampering biasing attack for increasing the average E[ f(Un) ] of any efficient function f: {0, 1} n↦ [ - 1, + 1 ] by Ω(p· Var [ f(Un) ]). In this work, we revisit and extend the bitwise tampering model of [1] to blockwise setting, where blocks of randomness becomes tamperable with independent probability p. Our main result is an efficient blockwise p-tampering attack to bias the average E[ f(X¯) ] of any efficient function f mapping arbitrary X¯ to [ - 1, + 1 ] by Ω(p· Var [ f(X¯) ]) regardless of how X¯ is partitioned into individually tamperable blocks X¯ = (X1, ⋯, Xn). Relying on previous works of [1, 19, 36], our main biasing attack immediately implies efficient attacks against the privacy primitives as well as seedless multi-source extractors, in a model where the attacker gets to tamper with each block (or source) of the randomness with independent probability p. Further, we show how to increase the classification error of deterministic learners in the so called ‘targeted poisoning’ attack model under Valiant’s adversarial noise. In this model, an attacker has a ‘target’ test data d in mind and wishes to increase the error of classifying d while she gets to tamper with each training example with independent probability p an in an online way. © 2017, International Association for Cryptologic Research.",,Probability; Random processes; Value engineering; Viruses; Attack model; Classification errors; Cryptographic primitives; Multi-Sources; Probability p; Randomized Algorithms; Tampering attacks; Training example; Cryptography,,,,,"Austrin, P., Chung, K.-M., Mahmoody, M., Pass, R., Seth, K., On the impossibility of cryptography with tamperable randomness (2014) CRYPTO 2014.

Various reports demonstrate the enormous burden placed on companies, which have to grapple with the ongoing attack waves. At the same time, our strategic understanding of the threat and the adversarial interaction between organizations and cybercriminals perpetrating ransomware attacks is lacking. In this paper, we develop, to the best of our knowledge, the first game-theoretic model of the ransomware ecosystem. Our model captures a multi-stage scenario involving organizations from different industry sectors facing a sophisticated ransomware attacker. We place particular emphasis on the decision of companies to invest in backup technologies as part of a contingency plan, and the economic incentives to pay a ransom if impacted by an attack. We further study to which degree comprehensive industry-wide backup investments can serve as a deterrent for ongoing attacks. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Backups; Game theory; Ransomware; Security economics,Decision theory; Economics; Game theory; Backups; Contingency plans; Cyber-crimes; Cybercriminals; Economic incentive; Game-theoretic model; Industry sectors; Security Economics; Malware,,,,,"Acquisti, A., Grossklags, J., What can behavioral economics teach us about privacy?

The legitimate nodes of the PLC network try to communicate with the anchor node of the network while the jamming node attempts to degrade the system performance. The fading, attenuation and colored noise of the PLC channel with dependence on the frequency and transmission distance are taken into account. To investigate the jamming problem, we frame the adversarial interaction into a Bayesian game, where the PLC network tries to maximize the overall expected network capacity and the jammer node has the opposite goal. In the Bayesian game, both players have imperfect knowledge of their opponents. We study effects of total power available to the players on the equilibrium of the game by formulating it into zero-sum and non-zero-sum games, respectively. It is found that under some network setup, there exists a threshold power for which the actual gameplay of the legitimate nodes does not depend upon the actions of the jamming node, and vice versa. This allows us to choose the appropriate power allocation schemes given the total power and the action of the jamming node in some cases. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Bayesian nash equilibrium; Game theory; Jamming attack; Non-zero-sum game; Power line communication; Security; Zero-sum game,Carrier transmission on power lines; Decision theory; Jamming; Bayesian Nash equilibria; Jamming attacks; Power line communications; Security; Zero-sum game; Game theory,,,,,"Pavlidou, N., Han Vinck, A.J., Yazdani, J., Honary, B., Power line communications: State of the art and future trends (2003) IEEE Commun.

Particularly, we design sensor outputs cautiously against advanced persistent threats that can intervene in cyber-physical systems. Such threats are designed for the very specific target systems and seeking to achieve their malicious goals in the long term while avoiding intrusion detection. Since such attacks can avoid detection mechanisms, the controller of the system could have already been intervened in by an adversary. Disregarding such a possibility and disclosing information without caution can have severe consequences. Therefore, through secure sensor design, we seek to minimize the damage of such undetected attacks in cyber-physical systems while impacting the ordinary operations of the system at minimum. We, specifically, consider a controlled Markov-Gaussian process, where a sensor observes the state of the system and discloses information to a controller that can have friendly or adversarial intentions. We show that sensor outputs that are memoryless and linear in the state of the system can be optimal, in the sense of game-theoretic hierarchical equilibrium, within the general class of strategies. We also provide a semi-definite programming based algorithm to design the secure sensor outputs numerically. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Advanced persistent threats; Cyber-physical systems; Security; Semi-definite programming; Sensor design; Stackelberg games; Stochastic control,Control theory; Controllers; Cyber Physical System; Decision theory; Embedded systems; Intrusion detection; Stochastic systems; Advanced persistent threats; Security; Semi-definite programming; Sensor designs; Stackelberg Games; Stochastic control; Game theory,,,,,"Başar, T., Olsder, G., (1999) Dynamic Noncoopertative Game Theory.

The core of Bitcoin, the Blockchain, is the history of all transactions committed by the system. This distributed ledger is similar to a distributed shared register where miners write and read blocks. New blocks in the Blockchain contain the last transactions in the system and are added by miners after a block mining process that consists in solving a difficult cryptographic puzzle. Although, the reward is the main motivation for the mining process in Bitcoin, it also may be an incentive for attacks such as selfish mining. In this paper we propose and theoretically analyze a solution for one of the major problems in Bitcoin: selfish mining or block-withholding attack. This attack is conducted by adversarial miners in order to either earn undue rewards or waste the computational power of honest miners. Contrary to the best to date solution for preventing block-withholding [6], our solution, ZeroBlock, prevents this attack by using a novel timestamp-free technique that exploits the Poisson nature of the proof-of-work and the current knowledge on the propagation of information in Bitcoin [2]. Note that previous solutions are vulnerable to forgeable timestamps. Additionally, our solution is compliant with miners churn. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,Electronic money; Miners; Network security; Peer to peer networks; Stabilization; Block-chain; Computational power; Electronic currency; Financial system; Mining process; Peer to peer; Proof of work; Time stamps; Solution mining,,,,,"Nakamoto, S., Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system (2008) Consulted, 1 (2012), p. 28; Decker, C., Wattenhofer, R., Information propagation in the bitcoin network (2013) 2013 IEEE Thirteenth International Conference on Peer-To-Peer Computing (P2P).

In the strategically-timed attack, the adversary aims at minimizing the agent's reward by only attacking the agent at a small subset of time steps in an episode. Limiting the attack activity to this subset helps prevent detection of the attack by the agent. We propose a novel method to determine when an adversarial example should be crafted and applied. In the enchanting attack, the adversary aims at luring the agent to a designated target state. This is achieved by combining a generative model and a planning algorithm: while the generative model predicts the future states, the planning algorithm generates a preferred sequence of actions for luring the agent. A sequence of adversarial examples is then crafted to lure the agent to take the preferred sequence of actions. We apply the proposed tactics to the agents trained by the state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithm including DQN and A3C. In 5 Atari games, our strategically-timed attack reduces as much reward as the uniform attack (i.e., attacking at every time step) does by attacking the agent 4 times less often. Our enchanting attack lures the agent toward designated target states with a more than 70% success rate.

For autonomous driving, environment perception sensors such as radars, lidars, and vision sensors play core roles as the eyes of a vehicle; therefore, their reliability cannot be compromised. In this work, we present a spoofing by relaying attack, which can not only induce illusions in the lidar output but can also cause the illusions to appear closer than the location of a spoofing device. In a recent work, the former attack is shown to be effective, but the latter one was never shown. Additionally, we present a novel saturation attack against lidars, which can completely incapacitate a lidar from sensing a certain direction. The effectiveness of both the approaches is experimentally verified against Velodyne’s VLP-16. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2017.",Attack; Autonomous car; Lidar; Saturating; Sensor; Spoofing,Cryptography; Embedded systems; Hardware; Sensors; Vehicles; Attack; Automotive applications; Autonomous car; Autonomous Vehicles; Environment perceptions; Saturating; Spoofing; Vehicle electronics; Optical radar,,,,,"Ackerman, E., Velodyne Says It’s Got a “Breakthrough” in Solid State Lidar Design., , http://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/sensors/velodyne-announces-breakthrough-in-solid-state-lidar-design; Alley, C.O., Bender, P.L., Dicke, R.H., Faller, J.E., Franken, P.A., Plotkin, H.H., Wilkinson, D.T., Optical radar using a corner reflector on the Moon (1965) J.

In the present study, however, the analysis of excerpts of parliamentary discourse addressed to women reveals not just aspects of the organization of rival political encounters but, as far as female MPs are concerned, aggressive and derogatory forms of speech that directly attack the gender of the addressees. Drawing on data from video-recordings, the official proceedings of parliamentary sittings, and the media (2012-2015), the present study investigates aggressive/sexist discourse within this context. The theoretical issues addressed concern the impoliteness end of the politeness/politic speech/impoliteness continuum in the light of extreme cases of conflict in political/parliamentary discourse. © 2017 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",aggression; conflict; im/politeness; politic speech; political/parliamentary discourse; sexism,,,,,,"Alvanoudi, A., (2014) Grammatical Gender in Interaction, , Cultural and Cognitive Aspects.

This adversarial nature makes security applications different from the classical machine-learning problem. For instance, an adversary (attacker) might violate the data stationary assumption that is a common assumption in machine learning techniques. This problem, named as the domain shift problem, arises when training and test data follow different distributions. Previous studies proposed an adversary-aware feature selection algorithm to improve robustness of the learning systems. However, prior studies in domain adaptation techniques which are fundamental in addressing domain shift problem demonstrate that original space may not be directly suitable for refining this distribution mismatch, because some features may have been distorted by the domain shift. In this paper, we propose an adversarial-aware feature extraction (AFE) model based on domain adaptation technique in order to address domain shift problem.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that specifically leverages this adversarial behavior for detection purposes. We show that phishing webpages can be accurately detected by highlighting HTML code and visual differences with respect to other (legitimate) pages hosted within a compromised website. Our system, named DeltaPhish, can be installed as part of a web application firewall, to detect the presence of anomalous content on a website after compromise, and eventually prevent access to it. DeltaPhish is also robust against adversarial attempts in which the HTML code of the phishing page is carefully manipulated to evade detection. We empirically evaluate it on more than 5,500 webpages collected in the wild from compromised websites, showing that it is capable of detecting more than 99% of phishing webpages, while only misclassifying less than 1% of legitimate pages. We further show that the detection rate remains higher than 70% even under very sophisticated attacks carefully designed to evade our system. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",,Computer crime; HTML; Security of data; Security systems; Detection rates; Large-scale deployment; Phishing; Phishing attacks; Visual differences; Web application firewalls; Websites,,,,,"Beardsley, T., (2005) Phishing Detection and Prevention, Practical Counter-Fraud Solutions, , Technical report, TippingPoint; Hong, J., The state of phishing attacks (2012) Commun.

Such adversarial examples can, for instance, be derived from regular inputs by introducing minor—yet carefully selected—perturbations. In this work, we expand on existing adversarial example crafting algorithms to construct a highly-effective attack that uses adversarial examples against malware detection models. To this end, we identify and overcome key challenges that prevent existing algorithms from being applied against malware detection: our approach operates in discrete and often binary input domains, whereas previous work operated only in continuous and differentiable domains. In addition, our technique guarantees the malware functionality of the adversarially manipulated program. In our evaluation, we train a neural network for malware detection on the DREBIN data set and achieve classification performance matching state-of-the-art from the literature. Using the augmented adversarial crafting algorithm we then manage to mislead this classifier for 63% of all malware samples. We also present a detailed evaluation of defensive mechanisms previously introduced in the computer vision contexts, including distillation and adversarial training, which show promising results. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",,Classification (of information); Computer crime; Distillation; Learning systems; Security of data; Security systems; Binary inputs; Classification performance; Data set; Defensive mechanism; Machine learning models; Malware detection; State of the art; Malware,,,,,"Androutsopoulos, I., Koutsias, J., Chandrinos, K.V., Paliouras, G., Spyropoulos, C.D., (2000) An Evaluation of Naive Bayesian Anti-Spam Filtering, , arXiv preprint arXiv:cs/0006013; Arp, D., Spreitzenbarth, M., Hubner, M., Gascon, H., Rieck, K., DREBIN: Effective and explainable detection of android malware in your pocket (2014) Proceedings of NDSS; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., The security of machine learning (2010) Mach.

However, the existence of correlated information in between these databases is a common source of privacy risk for the database users. In our study, we investigate such scenarios for attribute based linking attacks. These attacks refer to the common strategy by which an adversary can breach the privacy of the database respondents via exploiting the correlated information among the database attributes. In our work, we have proposed an information theoretic framework through which the achievable privacy levels following an adversarial linking attack are quantified. Our developed model also incorporates various aspects associated with micro-databases such as sanitization mechanism and auxiliary side information, thereby providing a more holistic structure to our theoretical framework. A comparative analysis of the various cases associated with our model theoretically confirms the notion that a sanitization mechanism facilitates in preserving the original privacy levels of the users.

This basic approach would be sufficient in handling server failure due to natural faults, because when one server fails, data from healthy servers can be used to restore the desired redundancy level. However, in a setting where servers are untrusted and can behave maliciously, data redundancy must be used in tandem with Remote Data Checking (RDC) to ensure that the redundancy level of the storage systems is maintained over time. All previous RDC schemes for distributed systems impose a heavy burden on the data owner (client) during data maintenance: To repair data at a faulty server, the data owner needs to first download a large amount of data, re-generate the data to be stored at a new server, and then upload this data at a new healthy server. We work on a new concept, namely, server-side repair, in which the servers are responsible to repair the corruption, whereas the client acts as a lightweight repair coordinator during repair. We propose two novel RDC schemes for replication-based distributed storage systems, RDC-SR and ERDC-SR, which enable server-side repair (thus taking advantage of the premium connections available between a CSP's data centers) and minimize the load on the client side. Although both schemes achieve a similar objective, RDC-SR assumes that the computational power of the CSP will not grow over time, whereas ERDC-SR relaxes this assumption and considers a CSP whose computational power can increase over time. Our guidelines on choosing the parameters of these schemes provide insights on their practical usage and also reveal that, whereas ERDC-SR can handle more powerful adversaries, it also imposes a minimal file size. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the two schemes. For the RDC-SR scheme, we build a prototype on the Amazon cloud and provide experimental results to support its effectiveness. Our prototype for RDC-SR built on Amazon AWS validates the practicality of this new approach. For the ERDC-SR scheme, our analytical performance analysis shows that the scheme is an order of magnitude more efficient than a simple extension of RDC-SR to defend against the stronger adversarial model. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

This approach can successfully resist denial of service attacks with acceptable CPU overhead and reduce convergence time caused by route mutation. Our contribution in this paper is threefold: (1) we provided model and method for smooth deployment of ARRM on software-defined networks; (2) we proposed extended shortest path calculation and route selection method to identify and select efficient route; (3) we simulated the interaction between ARRM defender and DoS attacker and develop analytical and experimental models to investigate the effectiveness and costs of ARRM under different mutation intervals and adversarial parameters. Our analysis and preliminary implementation show that ARRM can protect flow packets from being attacked against persistent DoS attackers and prolong attackers’ response time. Moreover, compared with traditional RRM schemes, our implementation shows that ARRM can efficiently decrease the recalculation time delay caused by route mutation with acceptable CPU costs. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Area-dividing route mutation; Moving target defense; Software defined networks,Computer crime; Network security; Software defined networking; Time delay; Area-dividing route mutation; Convergence time; Experimental models; Flow packets; Moving target defense; Multi path routing; Route Selection; Shortest path; Denial-of-service attack,,,,,"(2017), https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/trustworthy-cyberspace-strategic-plan-for-the-federal-cybersecurity-research-and-development; Zhuang, R., Deloach, S.A., Ou, X., Towards a theory of moving target defense (2014) 1St ACM Workshop on Moving Target Defense Proceedings, pp. 31-40. , ACM, New York; (2017), http://cps-vo.org/node/3854; Duan, Q., Al-Shaer, E., Jafarian, H., Efficient random route mutation considering flow and network constraints (2013) Communications and Network Security Proceedings, pp. 260-268. , IEEE, National Harbor; Kewley, D., Fink, R., Lowry, J., Dynamic approaches to thwart adversary intelligence gathering (2002) DARPA Information Survivability Conference & Exposition II, pp. 176-185. , IEEE, Anaheim; Atighetchi, M., Pal, P., Jones, C., Building auto-adaptive distributed applications: The QuO-APOD experience (2003) International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshop Proceedings, pp. 104-109. , IEEE Computer Society, Washington, DC; Antonatos, S., Akritidis, P., Markatos, E.P., Defending against hitlist worms using network address space randomization (2007) Comput.

For example there have been quite a few papers reporting that obfuscated JavaScript frequently comes with malicious functionality such as redirecting to external malicious websites. In order to capture such obfuscation, a class of detectors based on statistical features of code, mostly n-grams have been proposed and been claimed to achieve high detection accuracy. In this paper, we formalize a common scenario between defenders who maintain the statistical obfuscation detectors and adversaries who want to evade the detection. Accordingly, we create two kinds of evasion attack methods and evaluate the robustness of statistical detectors under such attacks. Experimental results show that statistical obfuscation detectors can be easily fooled by a sophisticated adversary even in worst case scenarios. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Adversarial machine learning; Novelty detection; Obfuscated JavaScript,Codes (symbols); High level languages; Learning systems; Security of data; Attack methods; Code obfuscation; Detection accuracy; Javascript; Novelty detection; Statistical codes; Statistical features; Worst case scenario; Statistics,,,,,"Canali, D., Cova, M., Vigna, G., Kruegel, C., Prophiler: A fast filter for the large-scale detection of malicious web pages (2011) 20Th International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 197-206. , ACM; Wang, W., Lv, Y., Chen, H., Fang, Z., A static malicious JavaScript detection using SVM (2013) 2Nd International Conference on Computer Science and Electronics Engineering, 40, pp. 21-30; Nishida, M., Obfuscated malicious JavaScript detection using machine learning with character frequency (2014) Information Processing Society of Japan SIG Technical Report, 21; Kamizono, M., Datasets for anti-malware research-MWS datasets 2013 (2013) Anti Malware Engineering Workshop; Laskov, P., Srndic, N., Static detection of malicious JavaScript-bearing PDF documents (2011) 27Th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference, pp. 373-382. , ACM; Al-Taharwa, I.A., Obfuscated malicious JavaScript detection by Causal Relations Finding (2011) 2011 13Th International Conference Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT), pp. 787-792. , IEEE; Kim, B., Im, C., Jung, H., Suspicious malicious web site detection with strength analysis of a JavaScript obfuscation (2011) Int.

For this purpose, we propose a comprehensive investigation of concrete adversaries trying to extract a PIN code from electroencephalogram signals. Overall, our results confirm the possibility of partial PIN recovery with high probability of success in a more quantified manner (i.e., entropy reductions), and put forward the challenges of full PIN recovery. They also highlight that the attack complexities can significantly vary in function of the adversarial capabilities (e.g., supervised/profiled vs. unsupervised/non-profiled), hence leading to an interesting tradeoff between their efficiency and practical relevance. We then show that similar attack techniques can be used to threat the privacy of BCI users. We finally use our experiments to discuss the impact of such attacks for the security and privacy of BCI applications at large, and the important emerging societal challenges they raise. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",,Brain computer interface; Interfaces (computer); Attack complexity; Brain computer interfaces (BCIs); Electroencephalogram signals; Entropy reduction; High probability; Human brain; Security and privacy; Side channel attack,,,,,"http://emotiv.com/, Accessed July 2016; http://neurosky.com/, Accessed July 2016; http://www.chesworkshop.org/, Accessed July 2016; Archambeau, C., Peeters, E., Standaert, F.-X., Quisquater, J.-J., Template attacks in principal subspaces (2006) CHES 2006.

Traditional incident management is response-driven, which is ineffective and costly, especially in countering adaptive adversaries. The security community has argued for a paradigm shift towards proactive and anticipatory cybersecurity. Defenders thus need to understand adaptive behaviors and dynamic decision-making processes of adversaries. Using a cyber-adversarial intrusion-chain model and empirical evidence of observations done at a force on force (""paintball"") exercise held at the 2015 North American International Cyber Summit (NAICS), this paper argues that understanding how adversaries adapt at various points in the intrusion chain is crucial in profiling adversaries and developing anticipatory cybersecurity measures. Specifically, this paper highlights the human aspects of cyber-attacks, with three specific objectives: (i) providing a preliminary temporal assessment of the cyber-attack process, (ii) understanding adversarial decision-making, cyber-attack disruptions and corresponding adaptability, and (iii) comprehending group dynamics, such as structure and interdependencies; cohesiveness and conflict; and division of labor.",Anticipatory cyber-defense; Cyber kill chain; Dynamic cyberdefense; Human behavior; Measurement and metrics,Behavioral research; Chains; Crime; Decision making; Mercury (metal); Network security; Adversarial decision making; Cyber defense; Cyber security exercise; Dynamic decision making; Human behaviors; Kill chain; Profiling adversaries; Temporal assessment; Computer crime,,,,,"Barnum, S., Standardizing cyber threat intelligence information with the Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX™) (2013) MITRE Corporation, , http://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/publications/stix.pdf, July.

Using a game-theoretic foundation, we seek to minimise expected damage from attacks or other adversarial events (e.g., emplacements of improvised explosive devices). Assuming that at most one camera may surveil a single point of interest (POI) at any time, a mixed-integer program uses an additive-probability model to optimise the placement of towers, while allocating 'aggregate, normalised surveillance time' between cameras and POIs. Linear-programming-based column generation then creates a probability distribution for camera-to-POI assignments to define implementable schedules. We prove that such schedules must exist, making the additive probability model exact. Computational examples on realistically sized problems produce high-quality solutions quickly, with quality suffering only when the number of cameras available nears the number of POIs to be surveilled. We show that an alternative game-theoretic model may produce better solutions when such a situation arises.

In this paper, we explore the security of machine learning in malware detection on the basis of a learning-based classifier. In particular, (1) considering different capabilities of the attackers (i.e., how much knowledge they have regarding feature representation, training set, and learning algorithm), we present a set of corresponding adversarial attacks and implement a general attack model AdvAttack to thoroughly assess the adversary behaviors; (2) to effectively counter these evasion attacks, we propose a resilient yet elegant secure-learning paradigm SecMD to improve the system security against a wide class of adversarial attacks.

In this work, we establish that reinforcement learning techniques based on Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) are also vulnerable to adversarial input perturbations, and verify the transferability of adversarial examples across different DQN models. Furthermore, we present a novel class of attacks based on this vulnerability that enable policy manipulation and induction in the learning process of DQNs. We propose an attack mechanism that exploits the transferability of adversarial examples to implement policy induction attacks on DQNs, and demonstrate its efficacy and impact through experimental study of a game-learning scenario. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Adversarial examples; Deep Q-Learning; Manipulation; Policy induction; Reinforcement learning; Vulnerability,Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Education; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Reinforcement learning; Adversarial examples; Input perturbation; Learning classifiers; Learning scenarios; Manipulation; Q-learning; Reinforcement learning techniques; Vulnerability; Deep learning,,,,,"Sutton, R.S., Barto, A.G., (1998) Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, 135. , MIT Press, Cambridge; Ghory, I., Reinforcement learning in board games (2004) Department of Computer Science, , University of Bristol.

Since its creation, it has been met with praise but also with close scrutiny. Concerns regarding security breaches have focused on in-person election observations, code reviews and adversarial testing on system components. These concerns have led many to conclude that there are various ways in which insider threats and sophisticated external attacks may compromise the integrity of the system and thus the voting process. In this paper, we examine the procedural components of the I-Voting system, with an emphasis on the controls related to procedural security mechanisms, and on system-transparency measures. Through an approach grounded in primary and secondary data sources, including interviews with key Estonian election personnel, we conduct an initial investigation into the extent to which the present controls mitigate the real security risks faced by the system. The experience and insight we present in this paper will be useful both in the context of the I-Voting system, and potentially more broadly in other voting systems. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Cybersecurity; E-voting; Human factors; Practical experiences; Procedural controls; Transparency,Computer privacy; Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Network security; Online systems; Security of data; Transparency; Cyber security; E-Voting; Internet voting system; Practical experience; Procedural security; Secondary data sources; Security breaches; System components; Voting machines,,,,,"I Esteve, J.B., Goldsmith, B., Turner, J., (2012), International experience with e-voting.

While there are many approaches to modeling network behavior and identifying anomalous and potentially malicious traffic, most of these approaches detect attacks once they have already occurred, enabling reaction only after the damage has been done. In traditional security studies, mitigating attacks has been a focus of many research and planning efforts, leading to a rich field of adversarial modeling to represent and predict what an adversary might do. In this paper, we present an analogous approach to modeling cyber adversaries to gain a deeper understanding of the behavioral dynamics underlying cyber attacks and enable predictive analytics and proactive defensive planning. We present a hybrid modeling approach that combines aspects of cognitive modeling, decision-theory, and reactive planning to capture different facets of adversary decision making and behavior. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Adversary modelling; Cognitive models; Cyber defense; Cyber simulation; Decision theory; Predictive analytics,Behavioral research; Cognitive systems; Decision making; Decision theory; Network security; Behavioral dynamics; Cognitive model; Cyber defense; Cyber simulation; Malicious traffic; Network systems; Reactive planning; Security studies; Predictive analytics,,,,,"Bremmer, I., These 5 Facts Explain the Threat of Cyber Warfare (2015) TIME, p. 19; Rosenberg, B., Furtak, M., Guarino, S., Harper, K., Metzger, M., Neal Reilly, S., Niehaus, J., Weyhrauch, P., Easing behavior authoring of intelligent entities for training (2011) Conference on Behavior Representation in Modeling and Simulation (BRIMS); Furtak, M., Introducing Agent Works (2009) 14Th Intelligent Agents Sub-Ipt; Li, S., Rickert, R., Sliva, A., Risk-based models of attacker behavior in cybersecurity (2013) SBP 2013.

In this work, we propose a linguistically-motivated approach for training robust models based on exposing the model to corrupted text examples at training time. We consider several flavours of linguistically plausible corruption, include lexical semantic and syntactic methods. Empirically, we evaluate our method with a convolutional neural model across a range of sentiment analysis datasets. Compared with a baseline and the dropout method, our method achieves better overall performance. © 2017 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,Computational linguistics; Semantics; Sentiment analysis; Language processing; Lexical semantics; Neural modeling; Overfitting; Robust models; Robust trainings; Training time; Deep neural networks,,,,,"Bahdanau, D., Cho, K., Bengio, Y., Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate (2015) Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations, , San Diego, USA; Baldwin, T., Cook, P., Lui, M., MacKinlay, A., Wang, L., How noisy social media text, how diffrnt social media sources?

However, this medium comes with risks and vulnerabilities–both technical and behavioral. SNSs are a proven haven for adversarial actors and content, and provide them with a lucrative attack vector into the DOD information networks. DOD policy, however, states that commanders must allow DOD personnel access to SNSs. Thus, commanders at all levels must balance appropriate Internet security measures while allowing access to Internet-based capabilities such as SNSs. This article examines both the technical and behavioral threats associated with SNS, the current DOD and Air Force policies on social media, and offers recommendations to minimize threats and maximize security, including a renewed emphasis on operational security and information security awareness training with a focus on social media. © 2017, U.S. Air Force, Air University.

These techniques promise scale and accuracy, which traditional rule/signature based methods cannot. However, classifiers operating in adversarial domains are vulnerable to evasion attacks by an adversary, who is capable of learning the behavior of the system by employing intelligently crafted probes. Classification accuracy in such domains provides a false sense of security, as detection can easily be evaded by carefully perturbing the input samples. In this paper, a generic data driven framework is presented, to analyze the vulnerability of classification systems to black box probing based attacks. The framework uses an exploration-exploitation based strategy, to understand an adversary’s point of view of the attack-defense cycle. The adversary assumes a black box model of the defender’s classifier and can launch indiscriminate attacks on it, without information of the defender’s model type, training data or the domain of application. Experimental evaluation on 10 real world datasets demonstrates that even models having high perceived accuracy (>90%), by a defender, can be effectively circumvented with a high evasion rate (>95%, on average). The detailed attack algorithms, adversarial model and empirical evaluation, serve as a background for developing secure machine learning based systems. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Adversary; Classification; Cybersecurity; Reverse engineering,Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Network security; Reverse engineering; Adversary; Classification accuracy; Classification system; Classification technique; Cyber security; Empirical evaluations; Experimental evaluation; Exploration exploitations; Classification (of information),,,,,"Abramson, M., Toward adversarial online learning and the science of deceptive machines (2015) 2015 AAAI Fall Symposium Series; Akhtar, Z., Robustness of multi-modal biometric systems under realistic spoof attacks against all traits (2011) BIOMS, pp. 1-6; Alabdulmohsin, I.M., Adding robustness to support vector machines against adversarial reverse engineering (2014) Proceedings of the 23Rd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, pp. 231-240; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., Can machine learning be secure?

There is an immediate need for anticipatory defense measures that reflect the adaptive and dynamic nature of adversaries. This paper highlights the human aspects of cyberattacks, with a specific focus on adversarial attack trajectories (or intrusion chains), how they manage attack disruptions and adapt, and how these adaptations can be measured. Using a criminological framework and empirical evidence of observations and interviews done at Industrial Control Systems Computer Emergency Response Team's (ICS-CERT) Red Team-Blue Team cybersecurity training exercise held at Idaho National Laboratory (INL), this paper argues that understanding how adversaries adapt at various points in their attack trajectories is crucial in profiling adversaries and developing anticipatory cybersecurity measures.",Anticipatory cyberdefense; Cyber kill chain; Dynamic cyberdefense; Human behavior; Measurement and metrics,Chains; Computer control systems; Computer crime; Intelligent control; Mercury (metal); Network security; Adaptive adversary; Computer emergency response teams; Cyber-defense; Human behaviors; Idaho national laboratories; Industrial control systems; Kill chain; Profiling adversaries; Behavioral research,,,,,"Barnum, S., (2013) Standardizing Cyber Threat Intelligence Information with the Structured Threat Information EXpression (STIX""), , http://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/publications/stix.pdf, MITRE Corporation, July; Cloppert, M., (2009) Security Intelligence: Attacking the Cyber Kill Chain, , http://digital-forensics.sans.org/blog/2009/10/14/security-intelligence-attacking-the-kill-chain, Retrieved February 2, 2014; (2012) Lifecycle of an Advanced Persistent Threat, , http://www.redteamusa.com/PDF/Lifecycle%20of%20an%20Advanced%20Persistent%20Threat.pdf, Retrieved September 19, 2013; Hutchins, E., Cloppert, M., Amin, R., (2011) Intelligence-driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains, , http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/corporate/documents/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf, Retrieved January 25, 2012; Ingoldsby, T., (2013) Attack Tree-based Threat Risk Analysis, , Amenaza Technologies Limited; Maxwell, J., Causal explanation, qualitative research, and scientific inquiry in education (2004) Educational Researcher, 33 (2), pp. 3-11; Rege, A., Incorporating the human element in anticipatory and dynamic cyber defense (2016) Proceedings of the the 4th International Conference on Cybercrime and Computer Forensics (ICCCF), , Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE; (2012) Stalking the Kill Chain, , http://www.emc.com/collateral/hardware/solution-overview/h11154-stalking-the-kill-chain-so.pdf, Retrieved March 31, 2014",,Lopez J.R.Bryant A.R.Mills R.F.,,Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited,"12th International Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security, ICCWS 2017",2 March 2017 through 3 March 2017,,127204,,9.78191E+12,,,English,"Proc.

His ingenious protocol prevents “sybil attacks” (where an adversary spawns any number of new players) by relying on computational puzzles (a.k.a. “moderately hard functions”) introduced by Dwork and Naor (Crypto’92). The analysis of the blockchain consensus protocol (a.k.a. Nakamoto consensus) has been a notoriously difficult task. Prior works that analyze it either make the simplifying assumption that network channels are fully synchronous (i.e. messages are instantly delivered without delays) (Garay et al. Eurocrypt’15) or only consider specific attacks (Nakamoto’08; Sampolinsky and Zohar, FinancialCrypt’15); additionally, as far as we know, none of them deal with players joining or leaving the protocol. In this work we prove that the blockchain consensus mechanism satisfies a strong forms of consistency and liveness in an asynchronous network with adversarial delays that are a-priori bounded, within a formal model allowing for adaptive corruption and spawning of new players, assuming that the computational puzzle is modeled as a random oracle. (We complement this result by showing a simple attack against the blockchain protocol in a fully asynchronous setting, showing that the “puzzle-hardness” needs to be appropriately set as a function of the maximum network delay; this attack applies even for static corruption.) As an independent contribution, we define an abstract blockchain protocol and identify appropriate security properties of such protocols; we prove that Nakamoto’s blockchain protocol satisfies them and that these properties are sufficient for typical applications; we hope that this abstraction may simplify further applications of blockchains. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2017.",,Computation theory; Crime; Cryptography; Adaptive corruptions; Asynchronous networks; Consensus protocols; Independent contributions; Protocol execution; Security properties; Simplifying assumptions; Typical application; Internet protocols,,,,,"Aspnes, J., Jackson, C., Krishnamurthy, A., (2005) Exposing Computationally Challenged Byzantine Impostors; Barak, B., Canetti, R., Lindell, Y., Pass, R., Rabin, T., Secure computation without authentication (2005) CRYPTO 2005.

We show that the hash function in the scheme is neither one-way nor collision-resistant in the view of a strong Type 1 adversary.We point out flaws in the security arguments and present attack algorithms that are successful in the strong Type 1 adversarial model using the weak properties of the hash function. © 2017 Seunghwan Chang et al.",,Computer networks; Information systems; Certificateless signature; Forking lemma; Lattice-based; Random Oracle; Random Oracle model; Security analysis; Security proofs; Hash functions,,,,,"Al-Riyami, S.S., Paterson, K.G., Certificateless public key cryptography (2003) Advances in Cryptology—ASIACRYPT 2003, 2894, pp. 452-473. , of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer, Berlin, Germany; Shor, P.W., Polynomial-time algorithms for prime factorization and discrete logarithms on a quantumcomputer (1997) Siamjournal on Computing, 26 (5), pp. 1484-1509; Peikert, C., Public-key cryptosystems from the worst-case shortest vector problem: Extended abstract (2009) Proceedings of the 41St Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC’09), pp. 333-342. , Bethesda, Md, USA; Regev, O., On lattices, learning with errors, random linear codes, and cryptography (2009) Journal of the ACM, 56 (6); Gentry, C., Peikert, C., Vaikuntanathan, V., Trapdoors for hard lattices and new cryptographic constructions (2008) Proceedings of the 40Th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC’08), pp. 197-206. , ACM, Victoria, Canada; Lyubashevsky, V., Micciancio, D., Asymptotically efficient lattice-based digital signatures (2008) Proceedings of the 5Th IACR Theory of Cryptography Conference (TCC’08), pp. 37-54. , New York, NY, USA; Lyubashevsky, V., Lattice signatures without trapdoors (2012) Advances in Cryptology—EUROCRYPT 2012, 7237, pp. 738-755. , of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer, Berlin, Germany; Tian, M., Huang, L., Efficient identity-based signature from lattices (2014) ICT Systems Security and Privacy Protection: 29Th IFIP TC 11 International Conference, SEC 2014, Marrakech, Morocco, June 2–4, 2014.

The possibility of limited connectivity and resource scarcity in DTNs make them vulnerable to various cyber-attacks, including interference attacks such as jamming. We study the defence against jamming attacks in a delay tolerant network with two adversarial players - the jammer, and the transmitter-receiver pair in a game theoretic environment. The transmitters seek to choose an optimal time to schedule the transmission securely to maximise the probability of successful delivery before the session expires, while signal interferences from the jammer attempts to minimise this probability. We design strategies for the transmitters that offset transmission period based inference of network traffic by the jammer. We deduce a solution for this game, using a probability distribution function over finite number of strategies for both the players to compute their expected payoff. Using a simulation test-bed, we create several scenarios in which the players are considered to have perfect/imperfect information and compute the expected payoff and resulting equilibrium values. The cases of perfect /imperfect information of the players are further studied using entropy based measures. These results are used to strategically evaluate the optimal time for the players, and assess the efficiency of the strategies used by the transmitters against jammer attacks. © 2017, DESIDOC.",Delay tolerant networks; Game theory; Jamming attacks; Optimal strategies; Timing constraint,Distribution functions; Game theory; Jamming; Network security; Probability; Probability distributions; Routers; Transmitters; Wireless networks; Infrastructure modeling; Intermittent networks; Jamming attacks; Optimal strategies; Simulation test beds; Timing constraints; Transmission delays; Transmission periods; Delay tolerant networks,,,,,"Venkataraman, V., Acharya, H.B., Shah, H., Lam, S., (2009) Delay Tolerant Networking-A Tutorial; Sun, W., Liu, C., Wang, D., On delay-tolerant networking and its application Proceeding of 2011 International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology (ICCSIT 2011); Raveneau, P., Chaput, E., Dhaou, R., Beylot, A., DTN for WSN: FREAK, implementations and study (2015) Proceedings of 12th IEEE Workshops on Consumer Communications and Networking Conference; Ntareme, H., Zennaro, M., Pehrson, B., Delay tolerant network on smartphones: Applications for communication challenged areas Proceedings of the 3rd ACM Extreme Conference on Communication: The Amazon Expedition; Xiao, M., Wu, J., Huang, L., Community-aware opportunistic routing in mobile social networks (2014) IEEE Trans.

However, such techniques may expose specific vulnerabilities that may be exploited by carefully-crafted attacks. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a well-known and widely-used learning algorithm. They make their decisions based on a subset of the training samples, known as support vectors. We first show that this behaviour poses risks to system security, if the labels of a subset of the training samples can be manipulated by an intelligent and adaptive attacker. We then propose a countermeasure that can be applied to mitigate this issue, based on infinity-norm regularization. The underlying rationale is to increase the number of support vectors and balance more equally their contribution to the decision function, to decrease the impact of the contaminating samples during training. Finally, we empirically show that the proposed defence strategy, referred to as Infinity-norm SVM, can significantly improve classifier security under malicious label contamination in a real-world classification task involving malware detection.

In this paper, instead of focusing on the security architecture in the upper layer, we investigate the secure transmission for a basic channel model in a heterogeneous network, that is, two-way relay channels. By exploiting the properties of the transmission medium in the physical layer, we propose a novel secure scheme for the aforementioned channel mode. With precoding design, the proposed scheme is able to achieve a high transmission efficiency as well as security. Two different approaches have been introduced: information theoretical approach and physical layer encryption approach. We show that our scheme is secure under three different adversarial models: (1) untrusted relay attack model, (2) trusted relay with eavesdropper attack model, and (3) untrusted relay with eavesdroppers attack model. We also derive the secrecy capacity of the two different approaches under the three attacks. Finally, we conduct three simulations of our proposed scheme. The simulation results agree with the theoretical analysis illustrating that our proposed scheme could achieve a better performance than the existing schemes. © 2017 Qiao Liu et al.",,Communication channels (information theory);

Unfortunately, currently no taxonomy exists to assist in the design and analysis of secure routing protocols. Based on the Dagstuhl Seminar 15102, this paper initiates the study of more structured approaches to describe secure routing protocols and the corresponding attacker models, in an effort to better understand existing secure routing protocols, and to provide a framework for designing new protocols. We decompose the routing system into its key components based on a functional model of routing. This allows us to classify possible attacks on secure routing protocols. Using our taxonomy, we observe that the most effective attacks target the information in the control plane. Accordingly, unlike classic attackers whose capabilities are often described in terms of computation complexity we propose to classify the power of an attacker with respect to the reach, that is, the extent to which the attacker can influence the routing information indirectly, beyond the locations under its direct control.",Adversarial Models; Taxonomy,Classification (of information); Taxonomies; Attacker models; Building blockes; Computation complexity; Design and analysis; Functional model; Routing information; Secure routing protocols; Structured approach; Routing protocols,,,,,"(2014), http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/netis-routers-leave-wide-open-backdoor/, Netis routers leave wide open backdoor; Ballani, H., Francis, P., Zhang, X., A study of prefix hijacking and interception in the internet (2007) Proc.

The diversity and usual stealthiness of APT turns them into a central problem of contemporary practical system security, since information on attacks, the current system status or the attacker's incentives is often vague, uncertain and in many cases even unavailable. Game theory is a natural approach to model the conflict between the attacker and the defender, and this work investigates a generalized class of matrix games as a risk mitigation tool for an advanced persistent threat (APT) defense. Unlike standard game and decision theory, our model is tailored to capture and handle the full uncertainty that is immanent to APTs, such as disagreement among qualitative expert risk assessments, unknown adversarial incentives and uncertainty about the current system state (in terms of how deeply the attacker may have penetrated into the system's protective shells already). Practically, game-theoretic APT models can be derived straightforwardly from topological vulnerability analysis, together with risk assessments as they are done in common risk management standards like the ISO 31000 family. Theoretically, these models come with different properties than classical game theoretic models, whose technical solution presented in this work may be of independent interest. © 2017 Rass et al.
