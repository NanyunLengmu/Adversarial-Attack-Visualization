Several works have addressed the problem of designing robust classifiers against these threats, although mainly focusing on specific applications and kinds of attacks. In this work, we propose a model of data distribution for adversarial classification tasks, and exploit it to devise a general method for designing robust classifiers, focusing on generative classifiers. Our method is then evaluated on two case studies concerning biometric identity verification and spam filtering. © 2011 IEEE.","adversarial classification; Pattern classification; robust classifiers","Adversarial environments; Can design; Classification system; Classification tasks; Data distribution; False alarms; General method; Identity verification; Malicious adversaries; Spam filtering; Biometrics; Cybernetics; Internet; Learning algorithms; Pattern recognition; Intrusion detection",,,,,"Dalvi, N., Domingos, P., Mausam, Sanghai, S., Verma, D., Adversarial classification 10th ACM SIGKDD Int.'l Conf.

Many methods have been proposed to anonymize one dataset and a series of datasets of a data owner. However, no method has been proposed for the anonymization of data of multiple independent data publications. A data owner publishes a dataset, which contains overlapping population with other datasets published by other independent data owners. In this paper we analyze the privacy risk in the such scenario and vulnerability of partitioned based anonymization methods. We show that no partitioned based anonymization methods can protect privacy in arbitrary data distributions, and identify a case that the privacy can be protected in the scenario. We propose a new generalization principle ε-cloning to protect privacy for multiple independent data publications. We also develop an effective algorithm to achieve the ε-cloning. We experimentally show that the proposed algorithm anonymizes data to satisfy the privacy requirement and preserves good data utility. © 2011 ACM.","adversarial attacks; anonymization; privacy","adversarial attacks; Anonymization; Data anonymization; Data distribution; Data publishing; Data sets; Effective algorithms; Good data; Privacy preserving; Privacy protection; Privacy requirements; Privacy risks; Algorithms; Cloning; Knowledge management; Population statistics; Publishing; Risk perception; Data privacy",,,,,"Aggarwal, G., Feder, T., Kenthapadi, K., Motwani, R., Panigrahy, R., Thomas, D., Zhu, A., Anonymizing tables (2005) ICDT'05, pp. 246-258; Agrawal, R., Kiernan, J., Srikant, R., Xu, Y., Hippocratic databases VLDB '02, pp. 143-154; Baig, M.M., Li, J., Liu, J., W, H., Studying genotype-phenotype attack on k-anonymized medical and genomic data (2009) AusDM, pp. 159-166; Brickell, J., Shmatikov, V., The cost of privacy: Destruction of data-mining utility in anonymized data publishing KDD '08, pp. 70-78; Cao, J., Karras, P., Kalnis, P., Tan, K.-L., Sabre: A sensitive attribute bucketization and redistribution framework for t-closeness (2011) JVLDB, 20, pp. 59-81; Chen, B.-C., Lefevre, K., Ramakrishnan, R., Privacy skyline: Privacy with multidimensional adversarial knowledge VLDB '07, pp. 770-781; Dwork, C., Differential privacy (2006) ICALP, pp. 1-12; Dwork, C., Mcsherry, F., Nissim, K., Smith, A., Calibrating noise to sensitivity in private data analysis 3rd Theory of Cryptography Conference, Springer, pp. 265-284; Friedman, A., Schuster, A., Data mining with differential privacy KDD'10, pp. 493-502. , ACM; Fung, B.C.M., Wang, K., Fu, A.W.-C., Pei, J., Anonymity for continuous data publishing EDBT '08, pp. 264-275; Ganta, S.R., Kasiviswanathan, S.P., Smith, A., Composition attacks and auxiliary information in data privacy KDD'08, pp. 265-273; Jiang, W., Clifton, C., Privacy-preserving distributed k-anonymity LNCS, 3654, pp. 924-924. , Data and Applications Security XIX (2005), Springer; Jiang, W., Clifton, C., A secure distributed framework for achieving k-anonymity (2006) JVLDB, 15, pp. 316-333; Jin, X., Zhang, M., Zhang, N., Das, G., Versatile publishing for privacy preservation KDD '10, pp. 353-362; Kifer, D., Attacks on privacy and definetti's theorem SIGMOD'09, pp. 127-138; Lefevre, K., Dewitt, D.J., Ramakrishnan, R., Mondrian multidimensional k-anonymity ICDE'06, p. 25; Lefevre, K., Dewitt, D.J., Ramakrishnan, R., Incognito: Efficient full-domain k-anonymity SIGMOD'05, pp. 49-60; Li, J., Wong, R.C.-W., Fu, A.W.-C., Pei, J., Anonymization by local recoding in data with attribute hierarchical taxonomies (2008) TKDE, 20, pp. 1181-1194; Li, N., Li, T., Venkatasubramanian S, T-closeness: Privacy beyond k-anonymity and ℓ-diversity ICDE'07, pp. 106-115; Machanavajjhala, A., Kifer, D., Gehrke, J., Venkitasubramaniam, M., ℓ-diversity: Privacy beyond k-anonymity (2007) TKDD; Malin, B., K-unlinkability: A privacy protection model for distributed data (2008) DKE, 64 (1), pp. 294-311; Martin, D., Kifer, D., Machanavajjhala, A., Gehrke, J., Halpern, J., Worst-case background knowledge for privacy-preserving data publishing ICDE'07, pp. 126-135; Meyerson, A., Williams, R., On the complexity of optimal k-anonymity PODS '04, pp. 223-228. , ACM; Muralidhar, K., Sarathy, R., Does differential privacy protect terry gross' privacy?

The fundamental challenge when developing reliable and secure distributed programs is to support the cooperation of processes required to execute a common task, even when some of these processes fail. Failures may range from crashes to adversarial attacks by malicious processes. Cachin, Guerraoui, and Rodrigues present an introductory description of fundamental distributed programming abstractions together with algorithms to implement them in distributed systems, where processes are subject to crashes and malicious attacks. The authors follow an incremental approach by first introducing basic abstractions in simple distributed environments, before moving to more sophisticated abstractions and more challenging environments. Each core chapter is devoted to one topic, covering reliable broadcast, shared memory, consensus, and extensions of consensus. For every topic, many exercises and their solutions enhance the understanding This book represents the second edition of ""Introduction to Reliable Distributed Programming"". Its scope has been extended to include security against malicious actions by non-cooperating processes.

A project started in graduate courses at Stevens Institute of Technology and currently pursued by the International Council on Systems Engineering Working Group on Systems Security Engineering works under the premise that security strategy will benefit by architectural patterns that are equally self organizing. To that end a pattern cataloging project is in process, identifying fundamental self organizing patterns that can explain the adversary operational modes and inform next generation security strategy. This article advances that pattern project by exploring and capturing the stigmergic communication employed by system-adversarial communities according to the pattern project guidelines. This article first identifies the unique stigmergic pattern, explores its nuances, and presents it in a format identified by the pattern project. Then the stigmergic pattern is applied as a mold to analyze a series of three systems in an effort to regard each within a familiar context. Three adversarial systems, the Iraqi Insurgency, IED Networks and Cybercrime, were selected as prominent opponents that provide significant consternation to security experts. They are first identified as agile systems, per characteristics defined by the pattern project, then studied in the context of the stigmergic pattern. © 2011 by Jena Lugosky and Rick Dove.",,"Adversarial system; Architectural pattern; Familiar contexts; Operational modes; Security strategies; Self organizing patterns; Stevens Institute of Technology; Stigmergic systems; Project management; Systems engineering; Agile manufacturing systems",,,,,"Adhami, W., The strategic importance of the Internet for armed insurgent groups in modern warfare (2007) International Review of the Red Cross, 89 (868). , Dec; Beckers, R., Holland, O.E., Deneubourg, J.L., From local actions to global tasks: Stigmergy and collective robotics (1994) Proc.

In an adversarial environment such as a battlefield, DTN nodes could be compromised to launch Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks by generating excess data, to cause an overflow of the limited resources of the legitimate nodes, hence decreasing the network throughput. A node may also display selfish behavior by generating more data than allowed, to increase its throughput and to decrease the latency of its data packets. In this paper, we term such a DoS attack and selfish data generation behavior, a resource-misuse attack. We study two types of resource-misuse attacks, breadth attacks and depth attacks. Accordingly, we propose different schemes to detect these attacks. Trace-driven simulations using both a synthetic and a real-world trace show that our detection schemes have low average detection latency and additionally, probabilistic detection of the depth attack has low false positive and false negative rates. © 2011 IEEE.","Delay-Tolerant Network; Denial-of-Service Attack; Probabilistic Detection","Adversarial environments; Attack detection; Data generation; Delay Tolerant Networks; Denial of service attacks; Destination nodes; Detection latency; Detection scheme; DoS attacks; End-to-end connectivity; False negative rate; False positive; ITS data; Network throughput; Non-existence; Source nodes; Trace driven simulation; Electrical engineering; Computer software selection and evaluation",,,,,"Fall, K., A Delay-Tolerant Network Architecture for Challenged Internets Proc.

We, therefore, model these problems as discrete-time infinite-horizon partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with undiscounted average payoff. Our solution creates a model of the observable subspace of the original POMDP, and then finds the control policy of the observable system. This requires neither a priori information nor belief state update. We compare our approach with the currently used value iteration approximation methods. The proposed approach reduces computational overhead, and provides better solutions under certain conditions. Furthermore, the long-run average payoff obtained by our method is predictable, which helps the controller to determine whether the algorithm performance at an acceptable level before implementation. © 2011 ACM.","HMM; POMDP; smart grid","Algorithm performance; Approximation methods; Computational overheads; Control policy; HMM; Infinite horizons; Partially observable Markov decision process; POMDP; Priori information; Smart grid; Value iteration; Approximation theory; Computer crime; Security of data",,,,,"Cassandra, A.R., A survey of POMDP applications (1998) AAAI Fall Symposium, , Presented at; Li, Y., Yin, B., Xi, H., Partially observable Markov decision processes and performance sensitivity analysis (2008) IEEE Trans., Man, Cybern.

Two practical scenarios are studied, i.e., path-key establishment and key pool bootstrapping. For both scenarios, previous work mainly focuses on preventing adversarial eavesdropping attacks. When the adversarial nodes can both eavesdrop and change the packets in the network, we show that an optimal scheme (in terms of error correction capability) can be obtained by using techniques from the literature of network error correction codes. In particular, for the path-key establishment problem, which has a particular topological structure, we propose a lightweight scheme with lower error probability and computational complexity than existing network error correction codes. For the key pool bootstrapping scenario, we show a connection with multisource network error correction coding, and show that network coding is necessary for optimal resilience against adversarial attacks. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Active adversary; Distributed wireless; Eavesdropping attacks; Error correction capability; Error probabilities; Key agreement; Key pool; Multisources; Network error correction; Optimal resilience; Optimal scheme; Topological structure; Lakes; Optimization; Security systems; Wireless networks",,,,,"Chan, H., Perrig, A., Song, D., Key Distribution Techniques for Sensor Networks, , http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/dawnsong/papers/randomkey.pdf, Technical report, Carnegie Mellon University.

Three of the players constitute a team of encoder, decoder and controller for a scalar discrete-time linear plant, while the fourth player is a jammer, who acts to flip the bits of the binary encoded observation signal of the communication channel between the plant and the controller. We assume that the observation and control signals have finite codelength. We characterize the encoding/decoding/control defense strategies available to the controller, and for simplicity in conveying the main ideas, we model it for a scalar discrete-time system with only one time step. We prove that there is no loss of generality in restricting our attention to binning-based encoding and control strategies. We determine the control and jamming strategies that are in saddle-point equilibrium for this game and show that the saddle-point value does not depend on the jamming policy.

Iterative dynamics are widespread in distributed algorithms and numerical analysis. However, efficient analysis of convergence and sensitivity of iterative dynamics is quite challenging due to the lack of systematic tools. For instance, the trajectories of iterative dynamics are usually not continuous with respect to the initial condition. Hence, the classical dynamical systems theory cannot be applied directly. In this paper, a trajectory distance based Lyapunov approach is proposed as a means to tackling convergence and sensitivity to the initial condition of iterative processes. Technically the problem of convergence and sensitivity is converted into finiteness of trajectory distance and semistability analysis of discrete-time systems. A semidefinite Lyapunov function based trajectory distance approach is proposed to characterize convergence and semistability of iterative dynamics. Two examples are provided to elucidate the proposed method. Finally, the proposed framework is used to solve the convergence and stability of iterative algorithms developed for balanced resource allocation and damage mitigation problems under adversarial attacks. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Convergence and stability; Discrete time system; Distance-based; Efficient analysis; Initial conditions; Iterative algorithm; Iterative process; Lyapunov approach; Numerical iterative algorithm; Semistability; Algorithms; Digital control systems; Discrete time control systems; Dynamics; Iterative methods; Lyapunov functions; Resource allocation; Trajectories",,,,,"Bhat, S.P., Bernstein, D.S., Nontangency-based lyapunov tests for convergence and stability in systems having a continuum of equilibra (2003) SIAM J.

In the presence of antagonistic interference, reliable communication in sensor networks becomes an extremely challenging problem that, in recent years, has attracted significant attention from the research community. This survey presents the current state of affairs in the formulation of theoretical models for adversarial interference in sensor networks and the different algorithmic remedies developed by the research community. There is a particular focus on jamming adversaries and Byzantine faults as these capture a wide range of benign faults as well as malicious attacks. The models in the literature are examined and contrasted with the aim of discerning the underlying assumptions that dictate analytical bounds with regards to feasibility and a number of performance metrics such as communication complexity, latency, and energy efficiency. Limitations are also highlighted with a focus on how various results impact real world applications and, conversely, how the current sensor network technology informs newer models.

Consequently, innovative methods that help determine the linkage between the rogue programs and adversaries are imperative for mitigating and combating botnet attacks. Recent study discovers that rogue programs are sold in black markets in online social networks and adversaries use online social networks to coordinate attacks. Correlation of botnet attacks and activities in online underground social networks is crucial to tactically cope with net-centric threats. In this paper, we take the first step toward adversarial behavior identification by modeling social dynamics of underground adversarial communities and tracing the origin of certain malwares and attack events in underground communities. We also describe our evaluation to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Black market; Command and control; Innovative method; Malwares; Net-centric; Online social networks; Social dynamics; Social Networks; Communication; Social networking (online); Dynamics",,,,,"Agarwal, N., Liu, H., Tang, L., Yu, P., Identifying the influential bloggers in a community (2008) Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Web Search and Web Data Mining (WSDM), pp. 207-218. , ACM; Gu, G., Yegneswaran, V., Porras, P., Stoll, J., Lee, W., Active Botnet Probing to Identify Obscure Command and Control Channels (2010) Proceedings of the 26th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC), pp. 241-253. , IEEE; Holt, G.W.B., Thomas, J., Bossler, A.M., Social Learning and Cyber Deviance: Examining the Importance of a Full Social Learning Model in the Virtual World (2010) Journal of Crime and Justice, p. 33; Holz, T., Raynal, F., Detecting honeypots and other suspicious environments (2005) Proceedings of the 6th Annual IEEE SMC, Information Assurance Workshop (IAW), pp. 29-36. , IEEE; Mislove, A., Marcon, M., Gummadi, K., Druschel, P., Bhattacharjee, B., Measurement and analysis of online social networks (2007) Proceedings of the 7th ACM SIGCOMM Conference on Internet Measurement (IMC), pp. 29-42. , ACM; Page, L., Brin, S., Motwani, R., Winograd, T., (1999) The Pagerank Citation Ranking: Bringing Order to the Web, , Technical Report 1999-66, Stanford InfoLab, November Previous number = SIDL-WP-1999-0120; Park, Y., Reeves, D., Identification of Bot Commands by Run-Time Execution Monitoring (2009) Proceedings of the 25th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC), pp. 321-330. , IEEE; Porras, P., Saidi, H., Yegneswaran, V., A foray into Conficker logic and rendezvous points Proceedings of the 2nd USENIX Workshop on Large-Scale Exploits and Emergent Threats (LEET), 2009; Rajab, M., Zarfoss, J., Monrose, F., Terzis, A., My botnet is bigger than yours (maybe, better than yours): Why size estimates remain challenging (2007) Proceedings of the 1st Usenix Workshop on Hot Topics in Understanding Botnets (HotBots), pp. 5-5. , USENIX Association; Salton, G., Buckley, C., Term-weighting approaches in automatic text retrieval (1988) Information Processing & Management, 24 (5), pp. 513-523; Stone-Gross, B., Cova, M., Cavallaro, L., Gilbert, B., Szydlowski, M., Kemmerer, R., Kruegel, C., Vigna, G., Your botnet is my botnet: Analysis of a botnet takeover (2009) Proceedings of the 16th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS), pp. 635-647. , ACM; Sturgeon, W., Internet Guru Warns of Botnet Pandemic, , http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/networking/2007/01/29/internet-guruwarns-of- botnet-pandemic-39285665/; Thomas, K., The Koobface botnet and the rise of social malware (2010) Proceedings of the 5th IEEE International Conference on Malicious and Unwanted Software (MALWARE), pp. 1-8","Zhao, Z.; Laboratory of Security Engineering for Future Computing (SEFCOM), , Tempe, AZ 85281, United States; email: zmzhao@asu.edu",,,,"54th Annual IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference: ""Energizing Global Communications"", GLOBECOM 2011","5 December 2011 through 9 December 2011","Houston, TX",88463,,9781424492688,,,"English","GLOBECOM IEEE Global Telecommun.

There are several technical challenges regarding deployment of a MANET, such as network scalability, communication stability, energy consumption, security and quality of services (QoS). Due to vulnerability of wireless links, nodes unstable infrastructure support and highly dynamic network states, MANET security becomes an essential design dimension. initially while designing MANET routing protocols security aspects were not considered, so routing protocols are vulnerable to various types of security attacks such as rushing attack, black hole attack, replay attack, jellyfish attack, wormhole attack, spoofing attack etc. In this paper we have discussed wormhole attack. In this paper, through simulation the effects of wormhole attack on Ad-hoc On Demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocols have been analyzed and compared. © 2011 IEEE.","AODV; DSR; MANET; routing attacks; security","AODV; DSR; MANET; Routing attacks; security; Artificial intelligence; Communication systems; Computer network performance evaluation; Energy utilization; Mobile ad hoc networks; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network security; Routing protocols; Telecommunication networks; Wireless networks; Computer crime",,,,,"Basagni, S., Conti, M., Giordano, S., Stojmenovic, I., (2004) Mobile Ad Hoc Networking, , IEEE Press, Wiley, Interscience; DjeNouri, D., Khelladi, L., A survey of security issues in mobile ad hoc and sensor networks IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, Fourth Quarter 2005, 7 (4), pp. 2-28; Kannhavong, B., Nakayama, H., Nemoto, Y., Kato, N., Jamalipour, A., A survey of routing attacks in mobile ad hoc networks (2007) IEEE Wireless Communications, 14 (5), pp. 85-91. , October; Perkins, C., Royer, Ad-hoc on-demand distance vector routing (1999) Proc. 2nd IEEE Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications, WMCSA'99, pp. 90-100; Johnson, D., Hu, Y., Maltz, D., (2007) The Dynamic Source Routing Protocol (DSR) for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks for Ipv4, , Network Working Group, RFC 4728; Toh, C.K., Royer, E.M., A review of current routing protocols for ad hoc mobile wireless networks (1999) IEEE Personal Communications, pp. 46-55; Perkins, C.E., Bhagwat, P., Highly dynamic destination-sequenced distance-vector routing (DSDV) for mobile computers (1994) Computer Communications Review, pp. 234-244; Jangra, A., Goel, N., Priyanka, Bhatia, K., Security aspects in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs): A big picture (2010) International Journal of Electronics Engineering, 2 (1), pp. 189-196; Perrig, A., Hu, Y.-C., Johnson, D.B., Wormhole protection in wireless ad hoc networks (2001) Technical Report TR01-384, Dept. of Computer Science, , Rice University; Scalable Network Technologies, , http://www.qualnet.com, Software Package, [Online]; Hu, Y.-C., Perrig, A., Johnson, D.B., Wormhole attacks in wireless networks (2006) IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 24 (2), pp. 370-380. , February; Parmar, J.D., Patel, A.D., Jhaveri, R.H., Shah, B.I., MANET routing protocols and wormhole attack against AODV (2010) International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security, 10 (4), pp. 12-18. , April; Manikandan, K.P., Satyaprasad, R., Rajasekhararao, K., A survey on attacks and defense metrics of routing mechanism in mobile ad hoc networks (2011) (IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 2 (3), pp. 7-12. , March; Sharma, V., Baghel, A., Analysis of AODV and DSR in presence of wormhole attack in mobile ad-hoc network (2010) International Journal of Engineering Science and Technology, 2 (11), pp. 6657-6662; Singh, G.K., Bindra, H.S., Sangal, A.L., Performance analysis of DSR, AODV routing protocols based on wormhole attack in mobile ad-hoc network (2011) International Journal of Computer Applications, 26 (5), pp. 38-41. , July","Agrawal, R.; Dept. of Electronics and Communication Engineering, , Allahabad, India; email: agrawalricha21@gmail.com",,"MPCT Group of Institutes Gwalior",,"2011 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Systems, CICN 2011","7 October 2011 through 9 October 2011","Gwalior",88171,,9780769545875,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

In this work we propose a holistic solution for detecting and confining insider attacks that couples reputation systems with clustering techniques, namely unsupervised genetic lgorithm and self-organizing maps, trained for detecting outliers in data. The novelty of this work is the redundancy in detecting agents, their evaluation based on the majority voting and the calculation of the reputation as the average value, which makes it more robust to different attack scenarios and their parameter variations. The algorithms use the feature space based on sequences of sensor outputs (both temporal and spatial), as well as the routing paths used to forward the data to the base station, and designed with the idea of introducing the ability to detect a wide range of attacks. The solution performs both attack detection and recovery from attacks, and it offers many benefits: scalable solution, fast response to adversarial activities, ability to detect unknown attacks, high adaptability and high ability in detecting and confining attacks. © 2011 IEEE.","clustering; insider attacks; reputation systems; wireless sensor networks","Attack detection; Average values; clustering; Clustering techniques; Detecting agent; Different attacks; Fast response; Feature space; Insider attack; Low level; Majority voting; Parameter variation; Reputation systems; Routing path; Scalable solution; Sensor output; Wireless sensor; Conformal mapping; Embedded software; Embedded systems; Self organizing maps; Sensors; Wireless sensor networks",,,,,"Karlof, C., Sastry, N., Wagner, D., TinySec: A link layer security architecture for wireless sensor networks (2004) SenSys'04 - Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems, pp. 162-175. , SenSys'04 - Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems; Malan, D.J., Welsh, M., Smith, M.D., A public-key infrastructure for key distribution in TinyOS based on elliptic curve cryptography Sensor and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks, 2004.

Path splicing improves the reliability of the network against link failures since it ensures that physically connected links can be discovered and used. To that end, this paper evaluates the performance of path splicing in non-adversarial and adversarial environments. In a non-adversarial setting, we investigate the implications behind giving the end-hosts the power to select routes in the absence/presence of errors in the probing mechanisms they are employing to infer the state of the network. In an adversarial setting, we examine the extent to which attackers can exploit path splicing to mount attacks that cause a series of path changes preventing the network from converging. Our results are derived from real traffic matrices obtained from the GÉANT network and from synthetic traffic matrices generated from the Sprint topology. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Mix rings architecture give better performance than mix-nets while maintaining anonymity that is stronger than onion routing. This paper presents an enhancement of mix rings, which is a hybrid P2P system and is designed to provide anonymity under a strong adversarial model in terms of identification, anonymity and resilience to collusion, along with low latency of data delivery and the link utilization. We use a double-layer overlay network, composed of nodes that are interested in anonymity and trusted index nodes and introduce several cluster escape and random extend mechanisms into mix rings. We present a description of the protocol, an analysis of common attack defense, and evaluate the degree of anonymity using MATLAB simulations. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","anonymous communication; cluster escape; hybrid P2P; mix rings","Anonymous communication; cluster escape; Data delivery; Double layers; Hybrid P2P; Index nodes; Internet application; Link utilization; Low latency; Matlab simulations; mix rings; Onion routing; Algorithms; Internet protocols; MATLAB; Network layers; Overlay networks; Peer to peer networks; Network architecture",,,,,"Reiter, M.K., Rubin, A.D., Anonymous Web transactions with crowds (1999) Commun.

It can be perceived that the advertisement is more effective by adding more ""bad"" words since more information could be transmitted to the customers. As a result, forcing the attackers to diminish the number of ""bad"" words is an important research problem in good word attacks. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to force the attackers to diminish the number of ""bad"" words. Rather than only considering if a word contained in an email, the proposed method use the frequency of a word appeared in an email to simulate the adversary attack and the defense mechanism. Our proposed defense method is compared with different existing methods experimentally. The results show that our proposed have a better performance among those methods in term of accuracy. © 2011 IEEE.","Adversarial attack; Frequency; Good word attacks","Adversarial attack; Defense mechanism; Frequency; Good word attack; Novel methods; Research problems; SPAM filter; Cybernetics; Internet; Learning systems; Electronic mail",,,,,"Daniel, L., Christopher, M., Good Words Attack on Statistical Spam Filters; Wei, L., Sanjay, C., Mining adversarial patterns via regularized loss miniminzation (2010) Machine Learning, 69-81. , April; Jorgensn, Z., Zhou, Y., Meador, I., A multiple instance learning strategy for combating good words attack on spam filters (2008) Journal of Machine Learning Research, pp. 1115-1146. , June; Globerson, A., Roweis, S., Nightmare at test time: Robust learning by feature deletion (2006) The 23rd International Conference on Machine Learning; Daniel, L., Christopher, M., (2005) Adversarial Learning, pp. 21-24. , ACM August; Nilesh, D., Domingos, P., Mausam, Sanghai, S., Deepak, V., (2004) Adversarial Classication, , ACM, August; Charles, S., Michael, S., McCallum, A., Feature bagging: Preventing weight undertraining in structured discriminative learning (2005) CIIR Technical Report IR-402, University of Masschusett; Marco, B., Nelson, B., Russell, S., Anthony, Joseph, D., Tygar, J.D., Can machine learning be secure?

Watson Research Center, Hawthorne, NY, United States","In many exciting multiagent applications - including future battlefields, law enforcement, and commerce - agents must communicate in inherently or potentially hostile environments in which an adversaries disrupt or intercept the communication between agents for malicious purposes, but the wireless ad hoc networks often proposed for these applications are particularly susceptible to attack. Intelligent agents must balance network performance with possible harm suffered from an adversary's attack, while accounting for the broadcast nature of their communication and heterogenous vulnerabilities of communication links. Furthermore, they must do so when the adversary is also actively and rationally attempting to counter their efforts. We address this challenge in this paper by representing the problem as a game between a sender agent choosing communication paths through a network and an adversary choosing nodes and links to attack. We introduce a network-flow-based approach for compactly representing the competing objectives of network performance and security from adversary attack, and provide a polynomial-time algorithm for finding the equilibrium strategy for the sender. Through empirical evaluation we show how this technique improves upon existing approaches. © 2011 IEEE.","Communication security; Multiagent communication; Network security game; Zero-sum game","Communication between agents; Communication path; Communication security; Empirical evaluations; Equilibrium strategy; Hostile environments; Multi-Agent; Multi-agent applications; Nodes and links; Polynomial-time algorithms; Zero-sum game; Communication; Intelligent agents; Multi agent systems; Network performance; Wireless ad hoc networks; Network security",,,,,"Mailler, R., Lesser, V., Solving distributed constraint optimization problems using cooperative mediation (2004) AAMAS'04; Petcu, A., Faltings, B., Mailler, R., Pc-dpop: A new partial centralization algorithm for distributed constraint optimization (2007) IJCAI'07; Washburn, A., Wood, K., Two-person zero-sum games for network interdiction (1995) Operation Research, 43 (2), pp. 243-251; Israeli, E., Wood, R.K., Shortest-path network interdiction (2002) Networks, 40, pp. 97-111; Bohacek, S., Hespanha, J., Obraczka, K., Saddle policies for secure routing in communication networks (2002) Decision and Control, 2002; Tsai, J., Yin, Z., Kwak, J., Kempe, D., Kiekintveld, C., Tambe, M., Urban security: Game-theoretic resource allocation in networked physical domains (2010) AAAI'10; Halvorson, E., Conitzer, V., Parr, R., Multi-step multi-sensor hider-seeker games (2009) IJCAI'09; Basilico, N., Gatti, N., Amigoni, F., Leader follower strategies for robotic patrolling in environments with arbitrary topologies (2009) AAMAS'09; Paruchuri, P., Pearce, J., Marecki, J., Tambe, M., Ordoñez, F., Kraus, S., Playing games with security: An efficient exact algorithm for Bayesian Stackelberg games (2008) AAMAS'08; Mavronicolas, M., Papadopoulou, V., Philippou, A., Spirakis, P., A network game with attackers and a defender (1995) Operation Research, 43 (2), pp. 243-251; Yin, Z., Korzhyk, D., Kiekintveld, C., Conitzer, V., Tambe, M., Stackelberg vs. Nash in SECURITY GAMES: Interchangeability, equivalence, and uniqueness (2010) AAMAS'10; Cidon, I., Rom, R., Shavitt, Y., Analysis of multi-path routing (1999) IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking; Anderson, D.G., Snoeren, A.C., Balakrishnan, H., Best-path vs. multi-path overlay routing (2003) ACM Internet Measurement Conference; Widmer, J., Boudec, J.-Y.L., Network coding for efficient communication in extreme networks (2005) ACM SIGCOMM Workshop on Delay Tolerant Networks; Park, J.-S., Gerla, M., Lun, D.S., Yunjung, Y., Medard, M., Codecast: A network-coding-based ad hoc multicast protocol (2006) IEEE Wireless Communications; Chaum, D., Untraceable electronic mail, return addresses, and digital pseudonyms (1981) Communications of ACM, 24 (2), pp. 84-88; Freedman, M.J., Morris, R., Tarzan: A peer-to-peer anonymizing network layer (2002) 9th ACM CCS; Srivatsa, M., Liu, L., Iyengar, A., Preserving caller anonymity in voice-over-ip networks (2008) IEEE Symposiumon Security and Privacy; Bertsimas, D., Tsitsiklis, J., (1997) Introduction to Linear Optimization, , Athena Scientific","Okamoto, S.; Computer Science Department, , Pittsburgh, PA, United States; email: sokamoto@cs.cmu.edu",,"IEEE Computer Society;Web Intelligence Consortium (WIC);Association for Computing Machinery (ACM);CNRS;Region Rhone Alpes;Artificial Intelligence Journal",,"2011 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology, IAT 2011","22 August 2011 through 27 August 2011","Lyon",87129,,9780769545134,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE/WIC/ACM Int.

These systems have been implemented in a variety of applications, most notably the popular Vuze BitTorrent client. Zage and Nita-Rotaru (at CCS 2007) and independently, Kaafar et al. (at SIGCOMM 2007), demonstrated that several widely-cited network coordinate systems are prone to simple attacks, and proposed mechanisms to defeat these attacks using outlier detection to filter out adversarial inputs. Kaafar et al. goes a step further and requires that a fraction of the network is trusted. More recently, Sherr et al. (at USENIX ATC 2009) proposed Veracity, a distributed reputation system to secure network coordinate systems. We describe a new attack on network coordinate systems, Frog-Boiling, that defeats all of these defenses. Thus, even a system with trusted entities is still vulnerable to attacks. Moreover, having witnesses vouch for your coordinates as in Veracity does not prevent our attack. Finally, we demonstrate empirically that the Frog-Boiling attack is more disruptive than the previously known attacks: systems that attempt to reject ""bad"" inputs by statistical means or reputation cannot be used to secure a network coordinate system. © 2011 ACM.","Attack; Network coordinate; Secure","Attack; BitTorrent; Distributed reputation systems; Euclidean; Network coordinate; Network coordinates; Network latencies; Outlier Detection; Secure; Secure networks; Statistical mean; Phase transitions; Computer crime",,,,,"Abraham, I., Malkhi, D., Compact routing on Euclidian metrics (2004) Proceedings of the 23rd Annual ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing (PODC'04), pp. 141-149. , ACM, New York, NY; Agarwal, S., Lorch, J.R., Matchmaking for online games and other latency-sensitive P2P systems (2009) Proceedings of the ACM SIGCOMM Conference on Data Communication (SIGCOMM'09)., pp. 315-326. , ACM, New York, NY; http://bamboo-dht.org, (accessed 2009); Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., Can machine learning be secure?

An important aspect of these systems is node failures over time, necessitating, thus, a repair mechanism in order to maintain a desired high system reliability. In such dynamic settings, an important security problem is to safeguard the system from a malicious adversary who may come at different time instances during the lifetime of the storage system to corrupt the data stored on some nodes. We provide upper bounds on the maximum amount of information that can be stored safely on the system in the presence of the adversary. For an important operating regime, which we call the bandwidth-limited regime, we show that our upper bounds are tight and provide explicit linear code constructions. Moreover, we provide a way to shortlist the malicious nodes and expurgate the system. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Amount of information; Distributed storage system; Linear codes; Malicious adversaries; Malicious nodes; Node failure; Operating regimes; Repair mechanism; Security problems; Storage systems; System reliability; Time instances; Upper Bound; Codes (symbols)",,,,,"Rhea, S., Wells, C., Eaton, P., Geels, D., Zhao, B., Weatherspoon, H., Kubiatowicz, J., Maintenance-free global data storage (2001) IEEE Internet Computing, pp. 40-49; Kosut, O., Tong, L., Tse, D., Nonlinear network coding is necessary to combat general byzantine attacks (2009) Proc. of 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing, , Oct; Dimakis, A., Godfrey, P., Wu, Y., Wainright, M., Ramchandran, K., Network coding for distributed storage systems (2010) IEEE Trans.

We assume that the adversary knows all messages, and noise values and the code used to communicate across the network. The adversary controls an unknown subset of edges and can replace the channel output vectors from those edges. We show that finding the capacity for the above network is equivalent to finding the capacity of a network that is obtained by replacing each finite input alphabet point-to-point channel by a noiseless link of the noisy channel capacity. Our result shows the asymptotic optimality of separation between channel coding for each link followed by network coding for the resulting network under the corresponding model of adversarial attack. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Asymptotic optimality; Channel output; Noisy channel; Channel capacity; Network coding",,,,,"Koetter, R., Effros, M., Médard, M., On the theory of network equivalence (2009) IEEE Inform.

In this paper, we examine the level of privacy protection provided by the current query obfuscation techniques against adversarial location service providers. As a representative and realistic implementation of query obfuscation, we focus on SybilQuery. We present two types of attacks depending upon whether or not a short-term query history is available. When history is available, using machine learning, we were able to identify 93.67% of user trips, with only 2.02% of fake trips misclassified, for the security parameter k = 5. In the absence of history, we used trip correlations to form a smaller set of trips effectively increasing the user query identification probability from 20% to about 40%. Our work demonstrates that the use of aggregate statistical information alone is not sufficient to generate simulated trips. We identify areas for improvement in the existing query obfuscation techniques. © 2011 ACM.","anonymity; location privacy; machine learning; query obfuscation","anonymity; Identification probability; location privacy; Location services; Machine-learning; Privacy protection; query obfuscation; Security parameters; Statistical information; User query; Human computer interaction; Learning systems; Ubiquitous computing",,,,,"Microsoft Multimap Api, , http://classic.multimap.com/openapidocs/1.2/demos/index.htm; Ben-Yacoub, S., Abdeljaoued, Y., Mayoraz, E., Fusion of face and speech data for person identity verification (1999) Neural Networks, IEEE Transactions on, 10 (5), pp. 1065-1074. , Sept; http://cabspotting.org/; Caldwell, C., (2005) A Pass on Privacy?, , http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/17/magazine/17WWLN.html?_r=1, Jul; Choe, J., (2007) Nyc Cab Drivers Say ""Nothanks"" to Gps Installation, , http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/17/magazine/17WWLN.html?_r=1, Mar Available at; Chow, C.-Y., Mokbel, M., Liu, X., Spatial cloaking for anonymous location-based services in mobile peer-to-peer environments (2009) GeoInformatica, pp. 1-30; Chow, C.-Y., Mokbel, M.F., Liu, X., A peer-to-peer spatial cloaking algorithm for anonymous location-based service ACM International Symposium on Advances in Geographic Information Systems, 2006; De Vel, O., Anderson, A., Corney, M., Mohay, G., Mining E-mail content for author identification forensics (2001) SIGMOD Record, 30 (4), pp. 55-64; Duckham, M., Kulik, L., A formal model of obfuscation and negotiation for location privacy (2005) Pervasive Computing, pp. 152-170; Finkel, R.A., Bentley, J.L., Quad trees a data structure for retrieval on composite keys (1974) Acta Informatica, 4, pp. 1-9; Frank, I.W.E., (2005) Data Mining-Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, , Second Edition.

Metastability is achieved by using precise programmable delay lines (PDL) that accurately equalize the signal arrival times to flip-flops. The PDLs are capable of adjusting signal propagation delays with resolutions higher than fractions of a pico second. In addition, a real time monitoring system is utilized to assure a high degree of randomness in the generated output bits, resilience against fluctuations in environmental conditions, as well as robustness against active adversarial attacks. The monitoring system employs a feedback loop that actively monitors the probability of output bits; as soon as any bias is observed in probabilities, it adjusts the delay through PDLs to return to the metastable operation region. Implementation on Xilinx Virtex 5 FPGAs and results of NIST randomness tests show the effectiveness of our approach. © 2011 International Association for Cryptologic Research.",,"Adaptive feedback control; Bistables; Circuit elements; Degree of randomness; Environmental conditions; Feed-back loop; Metastabilities; Monitoring system; Output bits; Programmable delay lines; Random Numbers; Randomness test; Real time monitoring system; Signal arrival time; Signal propagation delays; Cryptography; Embedded systems; Flip flop circuits; Monitoring; Random processes; Random number generation",,,,,"Barak, B., Shaltiel, R., Tromer, E., True random number generators secure in a changing environment (2003) LNCS, 2779, pp. 166-180. , Walter, C.D., Koç, Ç.K., Paar, C.

The SVM trains a classifier by solving an optimization problem to decide which instances of the training data set are support vectors, which are the necessarily informative instances to form the SVM classifier. Since support vectors are intact tuples taken from the training data set, releasing the SVM classifier for public use or shipping the SVM classifier to clients will disclose the private content of support vectors. This violates the privacy-preserving requirements for some legal or commercial reasons. The problem is that the classifier learned by the SVM inherently violates the privacy. This privacy violation problem will restrict the applicability of the SVM. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been work extending the notion of privacy preservation to tackle this inherent privacy violation problem of the SVM classifier. In this paper, we exploit this privacy violation problem, and propose an approach to postprocess the SVM classifier to transform it to a privacy-preserving classifier which does not disclose the private content of support vectors. The postprocessed SVM classifier without exposing the private content of training data is called Privacy-Preserving SVM Classifier (abbreviated as PPSVC). The PPSVC is designed for the commonly used Gaussian kernel function. It precisely approximates the decision function of the Gaussian kernel SVM classifier without exposing the sensitive attribute values possessed by support vectors. By applying the PPSVC, the SVM classifier is able to be publicly released while preserving privacy. We prove that the PPSVC is robust against adversarial attacks. The experiments on real data sets show that the classification accuracy of the PPSVC is comparable to the original SVM classifier. © 2011 IEEE.","classification; Privacy-preserving data mining; support vector machines","Classification accuracy; Decision functions; Design and analysis; Gaussian kernel functions; Gaussian kernels; Optimization problems; Post process; Privacy preservation; Privacy preserving; Privacy preserving data mining; Privacy violation; Real data sets; Sensitive attribute; Support vector; SVM classifiers; Training data; Training data sets; Classification (of information); Problem solving; Vectors; Support vector machines",,,,,"Chen, M.-S., Han, J., Yu, P.S., Data mining: An overview from a database perspective (1996) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 8 (6), pp. 866-883; Agrawal, R., Srikant, R., Privacy preserving data mining (2000) Proc.

An important aspect of these systems is node failures over time, necessitating, thus, a repair mechanism in order to maintain a desired high system reliability. In such dynamic settings, an important security problem is to safeguard the system from an intruder who may come at different time instances during the lifetime of the storage system to observe and possibly alter the data stored on some nodes. In this scenario, we give upper bounds on the maximum amount of information that can be stored safely on the system. For an important operating regime of the distributed storage system, which we call the bandwidth-limited regime, we show that our upper bounds are tight and provide explicit code constructions. Moreover, we provide a way to short list the malicious nodes and expurgate the system. © 2011 IEEE.","Byzantine adversary; distributed storage; network codes; secrecy","Amount of information; Byzantine adversary; Code construction; distributed storage; Distributed storage system; Malicious nodes; network codes; Node failure; Operating regimes; Repair mechanism; secrecy; Security problems; Storage systems; System reliability; Time instances; Upper Bound; Codes (symbols); Security systems; Data storage equipment",,,,,"Rhea, S., Wells, C., Eaton, P., Geels, D., Zhao, B., Weatherspoon, H., Kubiatowicz, J., Maintenance-free global data storage (2001) IEEE Internet Comput., 5 (5), pp. 40-49. , Sep./Oct; Bhagwan, R., Tati, K., Cheng, Y.-C., Savage, S., Voelker, G.M., Total recall: System support for automated availability management (2004) Proc.

For example, attackers can freely manipulate byte distributions within the attack payloads and thus inject well-crafted noisy packets to contaminate the suspicious flow pool. To address these attacks, we propose SAS, a novel Semantics Aware Statistical algorithm for automatic signature generation. When SAS processes packets in a suspicious flow pool, it uses data flow analysis techniques to remove non-critical bytes. We then apply a hidden Markov model (HMM) to the refined data to generate state-transition-graph-based signatures. To our best knowledge, this is the first work combining semantic analysis with statistical analysis to automatically generate worm signatures. Our experiments show that the proposed technique can accurately detect worms with concise signatures. Moreover, our results indicate that SAS is more robust to the byte distribution changes and noise injection attacks compared to Polygraph and Hamsa. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Data flow analysis; Hidden Markov model;

Focusing on interactive proof systems, one would like also to achieve unconditional soundness, so that proving a false statement is not possible even for a computationally unbounded adversarial prover. Motivated by such requirements, in this paper we address the problem of designing constant-round protocols in the plain model that enjoy simultaneously non-malleability (i.e., security against man-in-the-middle attacks) and unconditional soundness (i.e., they are proof systems). We first give a construction of a constant-round one-many (i.e., one honest prover, many honest verifiers) concurrent non-malleable zero-knowledge proof (in contrast to argument) system for every NP language in the plain model. We then give a construction of a constant-round concurrent non-malleable witness-indistinguishable proof system for every NP language. Compared with previous results, our constructions are the first constant-round proof systems that in the plain model guarantee simultaneously security against some non-trivial concurrent man-in-the-middle attacks and against unbounded malicious provers. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Concurrent non-malleability; Cryptography; Witness-indistinguishable proofs; Zero-knowledge proofs","Asynchronous networks; Interactive proof system; Man in the middle attacks; Non-malleability; Non-malleable; Non-malleable zero knowledge; Non-trivial; Proof system; Witness-indistinguishable proofs; Zero-knowledge proofs; Internet protocols; Network protocols; Network security; User interfaces; Programmable logic controllers",,,,,"Goldwasser, S., Micali, S., Rackoff, C., The knowledge complexity of interactive proof systems (1989) SIAM J.

In these attacks, adversaries induce honest nodes to exhibit undesirable behaviors by misrepresenting their intent or network conditions. Our method is based on a novel combination of static analysis with symbolic execution and dynamic analysis with concrete execution. The former finds code paths that are likely vulnerable, and the latter emulates adversarial actions that lead to effective attacks. Our method is precise (i.e., no false positives) and we show that it scales to complex protocol implementations. We apply it to four diverse protocols, including TCP, the 802.11 MAC, ECN, and SCTP, and show that it is able to find all manipulation attacks that have been previously reported for these protocols. We also find a previously unreported attack for SCTP. This attack is a variant of a TCP attack but must be mounted differently in SCTP because of subtle semantic differences between the two protocols.

In these applications a malicious adversary may successfully mislead a classifier by ""poisoning"" its training data with carefully designed attacks. Bagging is a well-known ensemble construction method, where each classifier in the ensemble is trained on a different bootstrap replicate of the training set. Recent work has shown that bagging can reduce the influence of outliers in training data, especially if the most outlying observations are resampled with a lower probability. In this work we argue that poisoning attacks can be viewed as a particular category of outliers, and, thus, bagging ensembles may be effectively exploited against them. We experimentally assess the effectiveness of bagging on a real, widely used spam filter, and on a web-based intrusion detection system. Our preliminary results suggest that bagging ensembles can be a very promising defence strategy against poisoning attacks, and give us valuable insights for future research work. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",,"Bootstrap replicates; Classification tasks; Ensemble construction; Intrusion Detection Systems; Lower probabilities; Malicious adversaries; Outlying observation; SPAM filter; Spam filtering; Training data; Training sets; Classification (of information); Internet; Pattern recognition systems; Statistics; User interfaces; Websites; Intrusion detection",,,,,"Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Joseph, A., Tygar, J., The security of machine learning (2010) Machine Learning, 81, pp. 121-148; Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., Can machine learning be secure?

Thus, it is fundamental to understand and analyse the effects of spoof attacks and propose new methods to design robust systems against them. To this aim, we are developing a method based on simulating the fake score distributions of individual matchers, to evaluate the relative robustness of different score fusion rules. We model the score distribution of fake traits by assuming it lies between the one of genuine and impostor scores, and parametrize it by a measure of the relative distance to the latter, named attack strength. Different values of the attack strength account for the many different factors which can affect the distribution of fake scores. In this paper we present preliminary results aimed at evaluating the capability of our model to approximate realistic fake score distributions. To this aim we use a data set made up of faces and fingerprints, including realistic spoof attacks traits. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Adversarial pattern recognition; Biometric systems; Performance evaluation; Spoof attacks","Biometric systems; Data sets; Multi-modal biometrics; Performance evaluation; Relative distances; Robust systems; Robustness evaluation; Score fusion; Spoof attacks; Biometrics; Image analysis; Pattern recognition systems",,,,,"Matsumoto, T., Matsumoto, H., Yamada, K., Hoshino, S., Impact of artificial ""gummy"" fingers on fingerprint systems (2002) Optical Security and Counterfeit Deterrence Techniques IV.

Despite considerable work in exploring the trust requirements of such defenses and in addressing the distribution speed of alerts, little work has gone into identifying how the underlying transport systems behave under adversarial scenarios. In this paper, we evaluate the reliability and performance trade-offs for a variety of control channel mechanisms that are suitable for coordinating large-scale collaborative defenses when under attack. Our results show that the performance and reliability characteristics change drastically when one evaluates the systems under attack by a sophisticated and targeted adversary. Based on our evaluation, we explore available design choices to reinforce the reliability of the control channel mechanisms. To that end, we propose ways to construct a control scheme to improve network coverage without imposing additional overhead. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",,"Control channels; Control mechanism; Control schemes; Defense capability; Honey net; Honeypots; Host-based; Network coverage; Network signaling; Performance trade-off; Reliability characteristics; Transport systems; Control mechanism; Defense capability; Network coverage; Network signaling; Performance and reliabilities; Performance trade-off; Security-critical; Transport systems; Cryptography; Online systems; Reliability; Chromium compounds; Cryptography; Economic and social effects; Online systems; Reliability; Security of data; Network security; Network security",,,,,"Aspnes, J., Rustagi, N., Saia, J., Worm versus alert: Who wins in a battle for control of a large-scale network?

The list of different attacks against them is extensive. Attacks like bad mouthing, newcomer, sybil, collusion and many more are subject to current research. Some of them present methods that allow to detect adversarial behaviour, hence providing protection against attacks. However, smart adversaries will adapt their behaviour strategies to the existing protection mechanisms and bypass some of the security methods. In this paper, we discuss the options available to adversaries for achieving their goal: Gaining a benefit. For this, we analyse the well-known attacks and propose security methods which provide resistance or immunity against them at any time, hence independently from the cleverness or strategy of adversaries. Our second focus is to elaborate on the problem of reliably identifying an adversary amongst transacting participants and its influence on possible security methods. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","adversary; security methods; Trust model","adversary; Bad mouthing; Different attacks; Protection mechanisms; Security issues; Security methods; Trust and reputation; Trust models; adversary; Bad mouthing; Different attacks; Protection mechanisms; Security issues; Security methods; Trust and reputation systems; Trust modeling; Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Trusted computing",,,,,"Anderson, S., Friedman, D., Milam, G., Singh, N., Seller strategies on ebay (2004) EconWPA, , Industrial Organization 0412004, December; Brown, J., Morgan, J., (2006) Reputation in Online Markets: Some Negative Feedback, , February; Buchegger, S., Le Boudec, J.-Y., A robust reputation system for mobile ad-hoc networks Proceedings of P2PEcon (2003), , Technical report; Dellarocas, C., Immunizing online reputation reporting systems against unfair ratings and discriminatory behavior (2000) EC 2000: Proceedings of the 2nd ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce, pp. 150-157. , ACM, New York; Douceur, J.R., The sybil attack (2002) LNCS, 2429, pp. 251-260. , Druschel, P., Kaashoek, M.F., Rowstron, A.

In order to measure robustness, we introduce new metrics based on a notion defined in [1]. We argue that our metrics are more appropriate to measure the robustness of network configurations than the widely known connectivity based metrics. We formalize the problem of selecting the sink nodes as an optimization problem aiming at minimizing the deployment budget while achieving a certain level of robustness.We propose an efficient greedy heuristic algorithm that approximates the optimal solution reasonably well. © 2011 IEEE.","denial-of-service attacks; topology robustness measures; wireless sensor networks","Adversarial environments; Denial of Service; Denial of service attacks; Network configuration; Optimal selection; Optimal solutions; Optimization problems; Sink nodes; Wireless sensor; Heuristic algorithms; Optimization; Outsourcing; Sensor nodes; Sensors; Topology; Wireless networks",,,,,"Cunningham, W.H., Optimal attack and reinforcement of a network (1985) J.

We consider an adversary that aims at tampering with the clock synchronization by intercepting messages, replaying intercepted messages (after the adversary's choice of delay), and capturing nodes (i.e., revealing their secret keys and impersonating them). We present an efficient clock sampling algorithm which tolerates attacks by this adversary, collisions, a bounded amount of losses due to ambient noise, and a bounded number of captured nodes that can jam, intercept, and send fake messages. The algorithm is self-stabilizing, so if these bounds are temporarily violated, the system can efficiently stabilize back to a correct state. Using this clock sampling algorithm, we construct the first self-stabilizing algorithm for secure clock synchronization in sensor networks that is resilient to the aforementioned adversarial attacks. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Our approach is based on probabilistic adversarial interactions between potential attackers and the system design models. These interactions result in a global model that is used to quantify security risks by applying probabilistic model-checking.

Unfortunately, there exist a great number of threats to these complex systems. In this context, it is crucial to understand the behaviors of power-law networks under various threats. Although power-law networks have been found robust under random failures but vulnerable to intentional attacks by experimental observations, it remains hard to theoretically assess their robustness so as to design a more stable complex network. In this paper, we assess the vulnerability of power-law networks with respect to their global pairwise connectivity, i.e. the number of connected node-pairs, where a pair of nodes are connected when there is a functional path between them. According to our in-depth probabilistic analysis under the theory of random power-law graph model, our results illustrate the best range of exponential factors in which the power-law networks are almost surely unaffected by any random failures and less likely to be destructed under adversarial attacks. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Power-Law Networks; Probabilistic Analysis; Robustness","Complex networks; Experimental observation; Exponential factors; In-Degree; Intentional Attacks; Node pairs; Power law distribution; Power-law graph; Power-law networks; Probabilistic analysis; Random failures; Social Networks; Stable complexes; Exponential factors; Intentional Attacks; Pairwise connectivities; Power law distribution; Power-law networks; Probabilistic analysis; Random failures; Random power-law graphs; Combinatorial mathematics; Social sciences computing; Web browsers; Combinatorial mathematics; Computation theory; Graph theory; Robustness (control systems); Web browsers; Internet; Complex networks",,,,,"Modeling s-t path availability to Support disaster vulnerability assessment of network infrastructure (2009) Computers & Operations Research, 36 (1), pp. 16-26; Aiello, W., Chung, F., Lu, L., A random graph model for power law graphs (2000) Experimental Math., 10, pp. 53-66; Albert, R., Albert, I., Nakarado, G.L., Structural vulnerability of the north american power grid (2004) Phys.

These attacks aimed at exhausting key resources of targeted hosts to diminish their capacity to provide or receive services. To defend the system against such attacks, we rely on clustering and implement induced churn to preserve randomness of nodes identifiers so that adversarial predictions are impossible. We propose robust join, leave, merge and split operations to discourage brute force denial of services and pollution attacks. We show that combining a small amount of randomization in the operations, and adequately tuning the sojourn time of peers in the same region of the overlay allows first to decrease the effect of targeted attacks at cluster level, and second to prevent pollution propagation in the whole overlay. © 2011 IEEE.","Adversary; Churn; Clusterized P2P Overlays; Collusion; Markov chains","Adversary; Churn; Collusion; Markov Chain; P2P overlays; Markov processes; Pollution; Peer to peer networks",,,,,"Naoumov, N., Ross, K.W., Exploiting p2p systems for ddos attacks (2006) Proceedings of the International Conference on Scalable Information Systems (Infoscale); Fiat, A., Saia, J., Young, M., Making chord robust to byzantine attacks (2005) Proceedings of the Annual European Symposium on Algorithms (AESA); Baumgart, I., Mies, S., S/kademlia: A practicable approach towards secure key-based routing (2007) Proceedings of the International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS); Anceaume, E., Brasileiro, F., Ludinard, R., Ravoaja, A., PeerCube: An hypercube-based p2p overlay robust against collusion and chum (2008) Proceedings of the International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems (SASO); Awerbuch, B., Scheideler, C., Towards scalable and robust overay networks (2007) Proceedings of the International Workshop on Peer-to-Peer Systems (IPTPS); Godfrey, P.B., Shenker, S., Stoica, I., Minimizing chum in distributed systems (2006) Proceedings of the ACM SIGCOMM; Anceaume, E., Brasileiro, F., Ludinard, R., Sericola, B., Tronel, F., Analytical study of adversarial strategies in c1usterbased overlays (2009) Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Reliability, Availability, and Security (WRAS); Castro, M., Druschel, P., Ganesh, A., Rowstron, A., Wallach, D.S., Secure routing for structured peer-to-peer overlay networks (2002) Proceedings of the Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDl); Ratnasamy, S., Francis, P., Handley, M., Karp, R., Shenker, S., A scalable content-addressable network Proceedings of the ACM SIGCOMM, 2001; Stoica, I., Liben-Nowell, D., Morris, R., Karger, D., Dabek, F., Kaashoek, M.F., Balakrishnan, H., Chord: A scalable peer-to-peer lookup service for internet applications (2001) Proceedings of the ACM SIGCOMM; Druschel, P., Rowstron, A., Past: A large- scale, persistent peer-to-peer storage utility (2001) Proceedings of the Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems (HatOS); Singh, A., Ngan, T., Drushel, P., Wallach, D., Eclipse attacks on overlay networks: Threats and defenses (2006) Proceedings of the Conference on Computer Communications (INFO COM); Sit, E., Morris, R., Security considerations for peer-to-peer distributed hash tables (2002) Proceedings of the International Workshop on Peer-to-Peer Systems (IPTPS); Hildrum, K., Kubiatowicz, J., Asymptotically efficient approaches to fault-tolerance in peer-to-peer networks (2003) Proceedings of TheInternational Symposium on Distributed Computing (DISC); Condie, T., Kacholia, V., Sankararaman, S., Hellerstein, J.M., Maniatis, P., Induced chum as shelter from routing-table poisoning (2006) Procs of the 13th Thirteenth Annual Symposium on Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS '06); Plaxton, C.G., Rajaraman, R., Richa, A.W., Accessing nearby copies of replicated objects in a distributed environment (1997) Proceedings of the 9th Annual, , ACM Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures (SPAA); Maymounkov, P., Mazieres, D., Kademlia: A peer-to-peer information system based on the XOR metric (2002) Proceedings for the International Workshop on Peer-to-Peer Systems (IPTP S); Locher, T., Schmid, S., Wattenhofer, R., EQuus: A provably robust and locality-aware peer-to-peer system (2006) Proceedings of the International Conference on Peer-to-Peer Computing (P 2P ); Douceur, J., The sybil attack (2002) Proceedings of the International Workshop on Peer-to-Peer Systems (IPTPS); Housley, R., Ford, W., Polk, W., Solo, D., (1999) Internet x.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Crl Profile; Lamport, L., Shostak, R., Pease, M., The byzantine generals problem ACM Transactions on P Rogramming Languages and Systems, 4 (1), p. 982; Anceaume, E., Ludinard, R., Sericola, B., Tronel, F., Performance analysis of large scale peer-to-peer overlays using markov chains (2010) IRISA, , http://hal.inria.fr/inria-00546039/en/, Tech.

The reputation of each node is assigned by an unsupervised genetic algorithm trained for detecting outliers in the data. The response of the system consists in assigning low reputation values to the compromised nodes cutting them off from the rest of the network. The genetic algorithm uses the feature extraction process that does not capture the properties of the attacks, but rather relies on the existing temporal and spatial redundancy in sensor networks and tries to detect temporal and spatial inconsistencies in the sequences of sensed values and the routing paths used to forward these values to the base station. This solution offers many benefits: scalable solution, fast response to thwart activities, ability to detect unknown attacks, high adaptability, and high ability in detecting and confining attacks. Comparing to the standard clustering algorithms, the benefit of this one is that it is not necessary to assign the number of clusters from the beginning. The solution is also robust to both parameter changes and the presence of large amounts of malicious data in the training and testing datasets.

In these attacks, adversaries induce honest nodes to exhibit undesirable behaviors by misrepresenting their intent or network conditions. Our method is based on a novel combination of static analysis with symbolic execution and dynamic analysis with concrete execution. The former finds code paths that are likely vulnerable, and the latter emulates adversarial actions that lead to effective attacks. Our method is precise (i.e., no false positives) and we show that it scales to complex protocol implementations. We apply it to four diverse protocols, including TCP, the 802.11 MAC, ECN, and SCTP, and show that it is able to find all manipulation attacks that have been previously reported for these protocols. We also find a previously unreported attack for SCTP. This attack is a variant of a TCP attack but must be mounted differently in SCTP because of subtle semantic differences between the two protocols. © 2011 ACM.","Manipulation attacks; Symbolic execution","IEEE Standards; Semantics; Transmission control protocol; 802.11 MAC; Complex protocols; False positive; OR-networks; Protocol implementation; Semantic difference; Symbolic execution; Static analysis",,,,,"Bellardo, J., Savage, S., 802.11 denial-of-service attacks: Real vulnerabilities and practical solutions (2003) USENIX Security; Bethea, D., Cochran, R., Reiter, M.K., Server-side verification of client behavior in online games (2010) NDSS; Brumley, D., Poosankam, P., Song, D.X., Zheng, J., Automatic patch-based exploit generation is possible: Techniques and implications (2008) Security and Privacy; Caballero, J., Liang, Z., Poosankam, P., Song, D., Towards generating high coverage vulnerability-based signatures with protocol-level constraint-guided exploration (2009) RAID; Cadar, C., Dunbar, D., Engler, D., Klee: Unassisted and automatic generation of high-coverage tests for complex systems programs (2008) OSDi; Cadar, C., Twohey, P., Ganesh, V., Engler, D., Exe: A system for automatically generating inputs of death using symbolic execution (2006) CCS; Chang, R., Jiang, G., Ivancic, F., Sankaranarayanan, S., Shmatikov, V., Inputs of coma: Static detection of denial-of-service vulnerabilities (2009) IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symp.; Chun, B.-G., Ratnasamy, S., Kohler, E., Netcomplex: A complexity metric for networked system designs (2008) NSDi; Costa, M., Zhou, M.C.L., Zhang, L., Peinado, M., Bouncer: Securing software by blocking bad input (2007) SOSP; De Moura, L.M., Bjørner, N., Z3: An efficient SMT solver (2008) TACAS; Ely, D., Spring, N., Wetherall, D., Savage, S., Anderson, T., Robust congestion signaling (2001) ICNP; Flanagan, C., Leino, K.R.M., Lillibridge, M., Nelson, G., Saxe, J.B., Stata, R., Extended static checking for Java (2002) PLDi; Godefroid, P., Klarlund, N., Sen, K., Dart: Directed automated random testing (2005) PLDi; Killian, C.E., Anderson, J.W., Jhala, R., Vahdat, A., Life, death, and the critical transition: Finding liveness bugs in systems code (2007) NSDi; King, J.C., Symbolic execution and program testing (1976) Commun.

In this model cooperative action is adopted to improve the UAV attacking performance. The actions of each UAV not only get benefit from attacking but also reduce the risks of other UAVs in the environment. The implications of the survival probabilities and the time discount factor are analyzed in this model and the result can provide a basis for building optimal attacking strategy. An improved genetic algorithm is applied to quickly build the optimal strategy. Simulation results show that this algorithm provides better solutions than genetic algorithm in attacking performance.","Attacking strategy; Cooperative attack; Genetic algorithm; Unmanned aerial vehicle","Adversarial environments; Aerial vehicle; Attacking strategy; Cooperative attack; Discount factors; Improved genetic algorithms; Optimal strategies; Survival probabilities; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Unmanned vehicles",,,,,"Toussaint, G.J., De Lima, P., Pack, D.J., Localizing rf targets with cooperative unmanned aerial vehicles (2007) American Control Conference, pp. 5928-5933. , New York; Kim, T.H., Sugie, T., Cooperative control for target-capturing task based on a cyclic pursuit strategy (2007) Automatica, 43 (8), pp. 1426-1431; Alighanbari, M., How, J.P., Cooperative task assignment of unmanned aerial vehicles in adversarial environments (2005) American Control Conference, pp. 4661-4666; Shen, Y.H., Zhou, Z., Evaluating operational effectiveness of AUAVs in search, classification and attack (2007) Journal of Northwestern Polytechnical University, 25 (4), pp. 608-613; Barbier, M., Chanthery, E., Autonomous mission management for unmanned aerial vehicles (2004) Aerospace Science and Technology, 8 (4), pp. 359-368; Huh, S., Shim, D.H., A vision-based landing system for small unmanned aerial vehicles using an airbag (2010) Control Engineering Practice, 18 (7), pp. 812-823; Cong, Y., Li, X.M., Tian, J.D., Real-time attitude angle estimation for unmanned aerial vehicle based on skyline detectio (2009) Chinese Journal of Scientific Instrument, 30 (5), pp. 940-943; Fan, J.J., Yang, Z., Feng, M.Y., Formation flight hardware-in-the-loop testbed system for multi-UAV (2009) Chinese Journal of Scientific Instrument, 30 (3), pp. 938-943; Li, W., Zhang, W., Method of tasks allocation of multi-UAVs based on particles swarm optimization (2010) Control and Decision, 25 (9), pp. 1359-1363; Dong, X.X., Chen, B.M., Cai, G.W., Development of a comprehensive software system for implementing cooperative control of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (2009) IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation, pp. 1629-1634. , Christchurch; Delima, P., Pack, D., Toward developing an optimal cooperative search algorithm for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (2008) International Symposium on Collaborative Technologies and Systems, pp. 506-512. , Irvine; Liang, X., Li, X.S., Yu, J.S., Research on the task schedule algorithm based on the GA (2009) Journal of Electronic Measurement and Instrument, 23 (2), pp. 19-24; Zhang, T.C., Fan, W.B., Li, Y.L., The comparative research of solving multi-task scheduling problems with GA and PSO (2009) Fifth International Conference on Natural Computation, pp. 459-463. , Tianjin; Chen, J., Wu, Y., Enterprise interoperability resource selection based on parallel genetic algorithm (2009) Journal of Electronic Measurement and Instrument, 23 (1), pp. 101-106; Yan, S.M., Zhou, X.S., Wang, L.M., GA-based automated task assignment on network processors (2005) Proceedings 11th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems, pp. 112-118; Liu, H., Huang, J.X., Feng, C.M., Optimal scheduling algorithm for real-time tasks in digital control systems based on GA (2008) Control and Decision Conference, pp. 74-79","Yao, M.; College of Automation Engineering, , Nanjing 210016, China; email: ym_nuaa@163.com",,,,,,,,02543087,,YYXUD,,"Chinese","Yi Qi Yi Biao Xue Bao",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052881569

Deployed mobile sensor nodes face a variety of physical security threats including theft, vandalism and physical damage. Unattended mobile sensor nodes must be able to respond to these threats with control policies that facilitate escape and evasion to a low-risk state. In this work the Precision Immobilization Technique (PIT) problem has been considered. The PIT maneuver is a technique that a pursuing, car-like vehicle can use to force a fleeing vehicle to abruptly turn ninety degrees to the direction of travel. The abrupt change in direction generally causes the fleeing driver to lose control and stop. The PIT maneuver was originally developed by law enforcement to end vehicular pursuits in a manner that minimizes damage to the persons and property involved. It is easy to imagine that unattended autonomous convoys could be targets of this type of action by adversarial agents. This effort focused on developing control policies unattended mobile sensor nodes could employ to escape, evade and recover from PIT-maneuver-like attacks. The development of these control policies involved both simulation as well as small-scale experimental testing. The goal of this work is to be a step toward ensuring the physical security of unattended sensor node assets. © 2011 SPIE.","Anti-tampering; Cyber-physical security; PIT; Precision immobilization technique; Self-preservation; Unmanned ground vehicle","Anti-tampering; Cyber-physical security; PIT; Precision immobilization technique; Self-preservation; Unmanned Ground Vehicles; Autonomous agents; Ground vehicles; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Sensor nodes; Telecommunication equipment; Unmanned vehicles; Unattended sensors",,,,,"Davis, R., (2011) Photo of Great White Shark Bite Damage to Spray Sea Glider Nose Cone and Discussions on Physical Security of Spray Gliders Courtesy of Russ Davis, , http://spray.ucsd.edu/pub/rel/index.php, La Jolla, California; Davis, R.E., Eriksen, C.C., Jones, C.P., Autonomous buoyancy-driven underwater gliders (2002) Pp 37-58 in the Technology and Applications of Autonomous Underwater, p. 324. , Vehicles.G.

Among the many protocols is the GKE protocol presented by Dutta and Dowling for mobile ad hoc networks. In this paper, we are concerned with the security of the Dutta-Dowling protocol. Their protocol carries a proof of security in the standard adversarial model which captures unknown key-share attacks.

Moreover, Xheal does this while allowing only low stretch and degree increase per node. The algorithm heals global properties like expansion and stretch while only doing local changes and using only local information. We use a model similar to that used in recent work on self-healing. In our model, over a sequence of rounds, an adversary either inserts a node with arbitrary connections or deletes an arbitrary node from the network. The network responds by quick ""repairs,"" which consist of adding or deleting edges in an efficient localized manner. These repairs preserve the edge expansion, spectral gap, and network stretch, after adversarial deletions, without increasing node degrees by too much, in the following sense. At any point in the algorithm, the expansion of the graph will be either 'better' than the expansion of the graph formed by considering only the adversarial insertions (not the adversarial deletions) or the expansion will be, at least, a constant. Also, the stretch i.e. the distance between any pair of nodes in the healed graph is no more than a O(log n) factor. Similarly, at any point, a node v whose degree would have been d in the graph with adversarial insertions only, will have degree at most O(κ d) in the actual graph, for a small parameter κ. We also provide bounds on the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian which captures key properties such as mixing time, conductance, congestion in routing etc. Our distributed data structure has low amortized latency and bandwidth requirements. Our work improves over the self-healing algorithms Forgiving tree [PODC 2008] and Forgiving graph [PODC 2009] in that we are able to give guarantees on degree and stretch, while at the same time preserving the expansion and spectral properties of the network. © 2011 ACM.","distributed; expanders; expansion; local; randomized; reconfiguration; self-healing; spectral properties","distributed; expanders; local; randomized; reconfiguration; Self-healing; Spectral properties; Algorithms; Data structures; Distributed computer systems; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Expansion; Information use; MESH networking; Repair; Trees (mathematics); Peer to peer networks",,,,,"Andersen, D., Balakrishnan, H., Kaashoek, F., Morris, R., Resilient overlay networks (2001) Operating Systems Review (ACM), 35 (5), pp. 131-145. , DOI 10.1145/502059.502048; Arak, V., (2007) What Happened on August 16, , http://heartbeat.skype.com/2007/08/what-happened-on-august-16.html, August; Awerbuch, B., Patt-Shamir, B., Peleg, D., Saks, M., Adapting to asynchronous dynamic networks (1992) STOC '92: Proceedings of the Twenty-fourth Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, pp. 557-570. , (extended abstract).

Cheriton School of Computer Science, Waterloo, ON, Canada","Imagine that Alice wants to send a message m to Bob, and that Carol wants to prevent this. Assume there is a communication channel between Alice and Bob, but that Carol is capable of blocking this channel. Furthermore, there is a cost of S dollars to send on the channel, L dollars to listen on the channel and J to block the channel. How much will Alice and Bob need to spend in order to guarantee transmission of m? This problem abstracts many types of conflict in information networks including: jamming attacks in wireless networks and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on the Internet, where the costs to Alice, Bob and Carol represent an expenditure of energy or network resources. The problem allows us to quantitatively analyze the economics of information exchange in an adversarial setting and ask: Is communication cheaper than censorship? We answer this question in the affirmative by showing that it is significantly more costly for Carol to block communication of m than for Alice to communicate it to Bob. Specifically, if S, L and J are fixed constants, and Carol spends a total of B dollars trying to block m, then Alice and Bob must spend only O(Bℓ - 1 + 1)=O(B.62+1) dollars in expectation to transmit m, where ℓ = (1 + √5)/2 is the golden ratio. Surprisingly, this result holds even if (1) B is unknown to both Alice and Bob; (2) Carol knows the algorithms of Alice and Bob, but not their random bits; and (3) Carol has total knowledge of past actions of both players. Finally, we apply our work to two problems: (1) DoS attacks in wireless sensor networks and (2) application-level DDoS attacks in a wired client-server scenario. Our applications show how our results can provide an additional tool in mitigating such attacks. © 2011 ACM.","byzantine fault tolerance; distributed denial-of-service attacks; energy efficiency; jamming attacks;

Our motivation comes from the observation that typical techniques of intrusion tolerance may in certain circumstances worsen the non-functional properties they were meant to improve (e.g., dependability). We start by modeling attacks as adversarial efforts capable of affecting the intrusion rate probability of components of the system. Then, we analyze several configurations of intrusion-tolerant replication and pro-active rejuvenation, to find which ones lead to security enhancements. We analyze several parameterizations, considering different attack and rejuvenation models and taking into account the mission time of the overall system and the expected time to intrusion of its components. In doing so, we identify thresholds that distinguish between improvement and degradation. We compare the effects of replication and rejuvenation and highlight their complementarity, showing improvements of resilience not attainable with any of the techniques alone, but possible only as a synergy of their combination. We advocate the need for thorougher system models, by showing fundamental vulnerabilities arising from incomplete specifications. © 2011 IEEE.","assumptions; availability; dependability; intrusion and attack models; intrusion tolerance; rejuvenation; reliability; replication; resilience; security","assumptions; Attack model; dependability; Intrusion tolerance; rejuvenation; replication; resilience; security; Endocrinology; Reliability",,,,,"Schneider, F.B., Implementing fault-tolerant service using the state machine aproach: A tutorial (1990) ACM Computing Surveys, 22 (4). , Dec; Huang, Y., Kintala, C.M.R., Kolettis, N., Fulton, N.D., Software rejuvenation: Analysis, module and applications (1995) Proceedings of 25th International Symposyum on Fault Tolerant Computing - FTCS-25, , Jun; Veríssimo, P.E., Neves, N.F., Correia, M.P., Intrusiontolerant architectures: Concepts and design (2003) Ser.

In this paper, we propose secure and intuitive device authentication techniques for the Smart Grid enabled Home Area Networks (HANs). We assume a distributed architecture for the HAN which consists of the smart appliances, the smart meter and the gateway. In this architecture, the operating schedules of the appliances are controlled by the gateway based on the pricing and control messages from the smart meter. We propose three different authentication mechanisms for devices in the HAN: 1) between the gateway and the smart meter, 2) between the smart appliances and the HAN, and 3) between the transient devices and the HAN. We show that the adversarial behavior during the authentication of devices such as the man-in-the-middle and impersonation attacks are prevented using the proposed device authentication mechanisms by extensive use of collaboration between different parties. Eventually, we provide secure and intuitive device authentication mechanisms (that require minimum or no user effort) for various parts of the HAN with low computation and communication overheads. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Authentication mechanisms; Authentication techniques; Communication overheads; Control messages; Distributed architecture; Home area network; Impersonation attack; Low-cost devices; Smart appliances; Smart grid; Smart meters; Authentication; Equipment; Gateways (computer networks); Network architecture; Smart power grids; Cryptography",,,,,"Alliance, Z., ZigBee Smart Energy Profile™ 2.0 Technical Requirements Document, , http://www.zigbee.org, available online; (2009) Securing the Smart Grid, , http://www.ciscosystemsnetwork.net/web/strategy/docs/energy/ SmartGridSecurity_wp.pdf, Cisco; Alliance, W., (2007) Introducing Wi-Fi Protected Setup, , http://www.wi-fi.org/wifi-protected-setup; Developer's Guide, , http://www.insteon.net; http://www.z-wave.com; Khurana, H., Bobba, R., Yardley, T., Agarwal, P., Heine, E., Design principles for Power Grid cyber-infrastructure authentication protocols (2010) Proceedings of the 43rd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS '10); Amin, M., Challenges in reliability, security, efficiency, and resilience of energy infrastructure: Toward smart self-healing electric power grid (2008) Power and Energy Society General Meeting: Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century, , July; Khurana, H., Hadley, M., Lu, N., Frincke, D.A., Smart-Grid security issues (2010) IEEE Security and Privacy, 8 (1), pp. 81-85; Metke, A.R., Ekl, R.L., Security technology for Smart Grid networks"" (2010) IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 1 (1), pp. 99-107. , June; Valli, C., The not so smart, Smart Grid-Potential security risks associated with the deployment of Smart Grid technologies (2009) Proceedings of the 7th Australian Digital Forensics Conference; Bennett, C., Wicker, S., Decreased time delay and security enhancement recommendations for AMI smart meter networks (2010) Proceedings of IEEE Innovative Smart Grid Technologies (ISGT); Bobba, R., Khurana, H., Alturki, M., Ashraf, F., PBES: A policy based encryption system with application to data sharing in the power grid (2009) Proceedings of the 4th International Symposium on Information, Computer, and Communications Security (ASIACCS '09); Wei, D., Lu, Y., Jafari, M., Skare, P., Rohde, K., An integrated security system of protecting Smart Grid against cyber attacks (2010) Proceedings of the 1st IEEE PES Conference on Innovative Smart Grid Technologies, , 19-21 Jan; Hamlyn, A., Cheung, H., Mander, T., Wang, L., Yang, C., Cheung, R., Computer network security management and authentication of smart grids operations (2008) Power and Energy Society General Meeting: Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century, , July; (2009) Cisco Carrier-grade IPv6 (CGv6) Solution, , Cisco","Ayday, E.; School of Electrical and Comp.

Instead of using systems with medium information content and high readout rates, we suggest to maximize the information content of the PUF while strongly reducing its readout frequency. We show that special, passive crossbar arrays with a very large random information content and inherently limited readout speed are suited to implement our approach. They can conceal sensitive information over long time periods and can be made secure against invasive physical attacks. To support our feasibility study, circuit-level simulations and experimental data are presented. Our design allows the first PUFs that are secure against computationally unrestricted adversaries, and which remain so in the face of weeks or even years of uninterrupted adversarial access. We term the new design principle a SHIC PUF, where the acronym SHIC stands for super high information content. © 2010 IEEE.","Crossbar memories; nonvolatile memories; physical cryptography; physical unclonable function (PUF)","Circuit-level simulation; Cross-bar memories; Crossbar arrays; Experimental data; Feasibility studies; High-capacity; Information contents; New design; nonvolatile memories; Physical attacks; physical cryptography; physical unclonable function (PUF); Physical unclonable functions; Readout rate; Sensitive informations; Time-periods; Access control; Cryptography",,,,,"Pappu, R., Recht, B., Taylor, J., Gershenfeld, N., Physical One-Way functions (2002) Science, 297 (5589), pp. 2026-2030. , Sep; Gassend, D.B., Clarke, D., Van Dijky, M., Devadas, S., Silicon physical random functions (2002) The CSC, , presented at Washington, DC, Nov. 18-22; Lim, D., Lee, J.W., Gassend, B., Suh, G.E., Van Dijk, M., Devadas, S., Extracting secret keys from integrated circuits (2005) IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems, 13 (10), pp. 1200-1205. , DOI 10.1109/TVLSI.2005.859470; Lim, D., (2004) Extracting Secret Keys from Integrated Circuits, , M.Sc. dissertation, MIT, Cambridge, MA; Gassend, B., Lim, D., Clarke, D., Van Dijk, M., Devadas, S., Identification and authentication of integrated circuits (2004) Concurrency Comput., Pract.

University St., West Lafayette, IN 47907, United States","Recent work in multicast routing for wireless mesh networks has focused on metrics that estimate link quality to maximize throughput. Nodes must collaborate in order to compute the path metric and forward data. The assumption that all nodes are honest and behave correctly during metric computation, propagation, and aggregation, as well as during data forwarding, leads to unexpected consequences in adversarial networks where compromised nodes act maliciously. In this work, we identify novel attacks against high-throughput multicast protocols in wireless mesh networks. The attacks exploit the local estimation and global aggregation of the metric to allow attackers to attract a large amount of traffic. We show that these attacks are very effective against multicast protocols based on high-throughput metrics. We conclude that aggressive path selection is a double-edged sword: While it maximizes throughput, it also increases attack effectiveness in the absence of defense mechanisms. Our approach to defend against the identified attacks combines measurement-based detection and accusation-based reaction techniques. The solution accommodates transient network variations and is resilient against attempts to exploit the defense mechanism itself. A detailed security analysis of our defense scheme establishes bounds on the impact of attacks. We demonstrate both the attacks and our defense using ODMRP, a representative multicast protocol for wireless mesh networks, and SPP, an adaptation of the well-known ETX unicast metric to the multicast setting. © 2006 IEEE.","Byzantine attacks.; high-throughput metrics; metric manipulation attacks; secure multicast routing; Wireless mesh networks","Adversarial networks; Byzantine attacks.; Compromised nodes; Data-forwarding; Defense mechanism; High-throughput; high-throughput metrics; Link quality; Local estimation; Maximize throughput; Measurement-based; metric manipulation attacks; Multicast protocol; Multicast routing; Multicast settings; Path metric; Path selection; Secure multicasts; Security analysis; Transient network; Unicast; Multicasting; Routing algorithms; Security of data; Throughput; Wireless mesh networks (WMN); MESH networking",,,,,"Dong, J., Curtmola, R., Nita-Rotaru, C., On the pitfalls of using high-throughput multicast metrics in adversarial wireless mesh networks (2008) Proc.

Box 293, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia","Malicious attacks when launched by the adversary-class against sensor nodes of a wireless sensor network, can disrupt routine operations of the network. The mission-critical nature of these networks signifies the need to protect sensory resources against all such attacks. Distributed node exhaustion attacks are such attacks that may be launched by the adversarial class from multiple ends of a wireless sensor network against a set of target sensor nodes. The intention of such attacks is the exhaustion of the victim's limited energy resources. As a result of the attack, the incapacitated data-generating legitimate sensor nodes are replaced with malicious nodes that will involve in further malicious activity against sensory resources. One such activity is the generation of fictitious sensory data to misguide emergency response systems to mobilize unwanted contingency activity. In this paper, a model is proposed for such an attack based on network traffic flow. In addition, a distributed mechanism for detecting such attacks is also defined. Specific network topology-based patterns are defined to model normal network traffic flow, and to facilitate differentiation between legitimate traffic packets and anomalous attack traffic packets. The performance of the proposed attack detection scheme is evaluated through simulation experiments, in terms of the size of the sensor resource set required for participation in the detection process for achieving a desired level of attack detection accuracy. The results signify the need for distributed pattern recognition for detecting distributed node exhaustion attacks in a timely and accurate manner. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, guaranteeing that the output from a candidate random source could not have been predicted by an outside party is a challenging task, and many supposedly random sources used today provide no such guarantee. Quantum solutions to this problem exist, for example a device which internally sends a photon through a beamsplitter and observes on which side it emerges, but, presently, such solutions require the user to trust the internal workings of the device. Here, we seek to go beyond this limitation by asking whether randomness can be generated using untrusted devices-even ones created by an adversarial agent-while providing a guarantee that no outside party (including the agent) can predict it. Since this is easily seen to be impossible unless the user has an initially private random string, the task we investigate here is private randomness expansion. We introduce a protocol for private randomness expansion with untrusted devices which is designed to take as input an initially private random string and produce as output a longer private random string. We point out that private randomness expansion protocols are generally vulnerable to attacks that can render the initial string partially insecure, even though that string is used only inside a secure laboratory; our protocol is designed to remove this previously unconsidered vulnerability by privacy amplification. We also discuss extensions of our protocol designed to generate an arbitrarily long random string from a finite initially private random string. The security of these protocols against the most general attacks is left as an open question. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,"Mayers, D., Yao, A., Quantum cryptography with imperfect apparatus (1998) FOCS 98: Proc. 39th Annu.

We demonstrated a weak attacker causing over 94% loss rate and intercepting more than 80% of data between peers. All attacks are practical, and validated experimentally on popular industrial and open-source products, with realistic network setups (involving NAT or tunneling). The interception attack requires a zombie behind the same NAT or tunnel-gateway as the victim destination; the other attacks only require a puppet (adversarial applet/script in sandbox). The complexity of our attacks depends on the predictability of the IP Identifier (ID) field and are simpler for implementations, e.g. Windows, which use globally-incrementing IP IDs. Most of our effort went into extending the attacks for implementations, e.g. Linux, which use per-destination-incrementing IP IDs. © 2011 USENIX Association.

However, these systems are vulnerable to a variety of covertchannel attacks that can be exploited by an adversarial querier. We describe several different kinds of attacks, all feasible in PINQ and some in Airavat. We discuss the space of possible countermeasures, and we present a detailed design for one specific solution, based on a new primitive we call predictable transactions and a simple differentially private programming language. Our evaluation, which relies on a proof-of-concept implementation based on the Caml Light runtime, shows that our design is effective against remotely exploitable covert channels, at the expense of a higher query completion time. © 2011 by The USENIX Association.",,"Completion time; Covert channels; Detailed design; Differential privacies; Private data; Proof of concept; Recent researches; Runtimes",,,,,"Agat, J., Transforming out timing leaks (2000) Proc.

This paper describes a simulation-based approach that helps analysts understand data and use it to predict future events and possible scenarios. In particular, the approach enables intelligence analysts to find, display and understand data relationships by connecting the dots of data to create network of information. The approach also generates alternative storylines, allowing analysts to view other possible outcomes. It facilitates the automation of reasoning and the detection of inconsistent data, which provides more reliable information for analysis.

Central to many of these security problems is a resource allocation task. For example, a police force may have limited personnel to conduct patrols, operate checkpoints, and conduct random searches. Other scarce resources including bomb-sniffing canines, vehicles, and security cameras. The key question is how to efficiently allocate these resources to protect against a wide variety of potential threats. The adversarial aspect of security domains poses unique challenges for resource allocation. A motivated attacker can gather information about security measures using surveillance and plan more effective attacks. Predictable resource allocations may be exploited by an attacker, greatly reducing resource effectiveness. A better approach for deploying security resources is to use randomization to increase the uncertainty of potential attackers. We develop new computational methods that use game-theoretic analysis to generate optimal randomized resource allocations for security domains. Game theory offers a more sophisticated approach to randomization than simply “rolling dice.” It allows the analyst to factor differential risks and values into the game model, and incorporates game-theoretic predictions of how the attacker will respond to a given security policy. Recent work by Paruchuri et al. uses a game-theoretic approach to create randomized security policies for traffic checkpoints and canine patrols at the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), which are deployed in the daily airport-security operations (Paruchuri et al., 2008; Pita et al., 2008). © Milind Tambe 2012.",,"Aluminum alloys; Computation theory; Computer games; Game theory; Random processes; Resource allocation; Security systems; Game theoretic analysis; Los angeles international airports; Potential threats; Security domains; Security measure; Security operations; Security problems; Transportation system; Airport security",,,,,"Avenhaus, R., Von Stengel, B., Zamir, S., Inspection games (2002) Handbook of Game Theory, Volume 3, Chapter 51, pp. 1947-1987. , R.

It is that to the extent that the prevention of future aggression is accepted as a just cause for war, the constraint against the initiation of war will be correspondingly eroded. For the claim that another state will, unless prevented, engage in aggression at some point in the future can be cynically exploited as a pretext or public rationale for virtually any unjust war of aggression. To the extent that states would avail themselves of this pretext for the resort to war, they would also become more fearful of becoming the target of an allegedly preventive war. Given the strategic advantages of striking first, each state in an adversarial relation with another would then have an increased incentive to strike first just to avoid being the victim of a first strike. Wars for which the public justification is that they are preventive thus tend to decrease security everywhere. The reason this objection is so compelling is that it suggests that the acceptance of a doctrine of preventive war could have dreadful consequences, particularly in areas plagued by settled animosities, such as those between India and Pakistan, North and South Korea, and Israel and most or all of its neighbors.

However, the analysis of group key exchange (GKE) protocols has not been as extensive as that of 2PKE protocols. Particularly, an important security attribute called key compromise impersonation (KCI) resilience has been completely ignored for the case of GKE protocols. Informally, a protocol is said to provideKCI resilience if the compromise of the long-term secret key of a protocol participant A does not allow the adversary to impersonate an honest participant B to A. In this paper, we argue that KCI resilience for GKE protocols is at least as important as it is for 2PKE protocols. Our first contribution is revised definitions of security for GKE protocols considering KCI attacks by both outsider and insider adversaries. We also give a new proof of security for an existing two-round GKE protocol under the revised security definitions assuming random oracles. We then show how to achieve insider KCIR in a generic way using a known compiler in the literature. As one may expect, this additional security assurance comes at the cost of an extra round of communication. Finally, we show that a few existing protocols are not secure against outsider KCI attacks. The attacks on these protocols illustrate the necessity of considering KCI resilience for GKE protocols. © 2011, ACM.

Thus, it is fundamental to understand and analyse the effects of spoof attacks and propose new methods to design robust systems against them. To this aim, we are developing a method based on simulating the fake score distributions of individual matchers, to evaluate the relative robustness of different score fusion rules. We model the score distribution of fake traits by assuming it lies between the one of genuine and impostor scores, and parametrize it by a measure of the relative distance to the latter, named attack strength. Different values of the attack strength account for the many different factors which can affect the distribution of fake scores. In this paper we present preliminary results aimed at evaluating the capability of our model to approximate realistic fake score distributions. To this aim we use a data set made up of faces and fingerprints, including realistic spoof attacks traits. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.","Adversarial pattern recognition; Biometric systems; Performance evaluation; Spoof attacks","Biometrics; Image analysis; Biometric systems; Multi-modal biometrics; Performance evaluation; Relative distances; Robust systems; Robustness evaluation; Score fusion; Spoof attacks; Pattern recognition systems",,,,,"Matsumoto, T., Matsumoto, H., Yamada, K., Hoshino, S., Impact of artificial “gummy” fingers on fingerprint systems (2002) Optical Security and Counterfeit Deterrence Techniques IV.

It suggests that critics need to attend more carefully to adversarial works that have eluded detection by authorities to better understand censor-avoiding and censor-baiting techniques. In examining Bernard Shaw's The Devil's Disciple, I argue that Shaw was subversive of morality and censorship through encoded attacks on the institution of the Lord Chamberlain's Office. This becomes clearer through analysis of Shaw's censorship discourse in the years following the writing of the play in which he taps into its ethos and adopts the perspective of the title character, especially in his promotion of American-style post-performance trials of plays as against the British system of applying for licences before production. Shaw also undertook auto-intertextuality by drawing upon The Devil's Disciple in composing The Shewing-Up of Blanco Posnet, a play that intentionally provoked British censors and provided him with ammunition when he appeared before the Joint Select Committee on the Censorship of Plays in the summer of 1909. I end by noting how Shaw himself refused war-time productions of The Devil's Disciple because of its threats to morality and its potential for instigating radical change.","Bernard Shaw; censorship; immorality; melodrama; representations of the United States in British theatre; The Devil's Disciple; The Shewing-Up of Blanco Posnet",,,,,,"Barrie, J.M., Galsworthy, J., Murray, G., Letter to Shaw, , 11 Feb. 1908.

In ideal situations, the adversary does not gain any knowledge about the prover's long-term secret. This makes designing a distance bounding protocol resistant to a such fraud tricky: the secrets of an honest prover must be protected, while those of a dishonest one should be disclosed as an incentive not to cheat. In this paper, we demonstrate that using a secret-sharing scheme, possibly based on threshold cryptography, is well suited for thwarting terrorist fraud. Although such an idea has been around since the work of Bussard and Bagga, this is the first time that secret-sharing and terrorist fraud have been systematically studied altogether. We prove that secret sharing can counter terrorist fraud, and we detail a method that can be applied directly to most existing distance bounding protocols. We illustrate our method on the protocol of Hancke and Kuhn, yielding two variants: the threshold distance bounding (TDB) protocol and the thrifty threshold distance bounding (TTDB) protocol. We define the adversarial strategies that attempt to gain some knowledge on the prover's long-term secret, evaluate the amount of information disclosed, and determine the adversary's success probability.

Automatic detection of masquerading attacks is generally undertaken by approaching the problem from an anomaly detection perspective: a model of normal behaviour for each user is constructed and significant departures from it are identified as potential masquerading attempts. One potential vulnerability of these schemes lies in the fact that anomaly detection algorithms are generally susceptible to deception. In this work, we first investigate how a resourceful masquerader can successfully evade detection while still accomplishing his goals. For this, we introduce the concept of masquerade mimicry attacks, consisting of carefully constructed attacks that are not identified as anomalous. We then explore two different detection schemes to thwart such attacks. We first study the introduction of a blind randomisation strategy into a baseline anomaly detector. We then propose a more accurate algorithm, called Probabilistic Padding Identification (PPI) and based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which attempts to identify if a sufficiently anomalous attack is present within an apparently normal behavioural pattern. Our experimental results indicate that the PPI algorithm achieves considerably better detection quality than both blind randomised strategies and adversarial-unaware approaches. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The runtime performance of these protocols is most commonly assessed in the absence of processor faults and is usually good in that case. However, faulty processors can significantly degrade the performance of some protocols, limiting their practical utility in adversarial environments. This paper demonstrates the extent of performance degradation possible in some existing protocols that do satisfy liveness and that do perform well absent Byzantine faults. We propose a new performance-oriented correctness criterion that requires a consistent level of performance, even with Byzantine faults. We present a new Byzantine fault-tolerant replication protocol that meets the new correctness criterion and evaluate its performance in fault-free executions and when under attack. © 2011 IEEE.","Byzantine fault tolerance; distributed systems.; Performance under attack; replicated state machines","Fault tolerance; Adversarial environments; Byzantine fault tolerance; Correctness criterion; Distributed systems; Performance degradation; Performance under attack; Replication protocol; State machine; Fault tolerant computer systems",,,,,"Amir, Y., Coan, B., Kirsch, J., Lane, J., Byzantine replication under attack (2008) Proc. 38th IEEE Int'l Conf.

Indeed, local monitoring-based security algorithms are becoming the most popular tool for providing security in WSNs. However, local monitoring as it is currently practiced is costly in terms of energy consumption, a major drawback for energy-constrained systems such as WSNs. In WSN environments, the scarce power resources are typically addressed through sleep-wake scheduling of the nodes. However, sleep-wake scheduling techniques in WSNs are vulnerable even to simple attacks. In this paper, a new technique is proposed that promises to allow operation of WSNs in a manner that is both energy-efficient and secure. The proposed technique combines local monitoring with a novel, more secure form of sleep-wake scheduling. The latter is a new methodology dubbed Elmo (Energy Aware Local MOnitoring in Sensor Networks), which enables sleep-wake management in a secure manner even in the face of adversarial nodes that choose not to awaken nodes responsible for monitoring their traffic. An analytical proof is given showing that security coverage is not weakened under Elmo. Moreover, ns-2 simulation results show that the performance of local monitoring is practically unchanged, while energy savings of 20 to 100 times are achieved, depending on the scenario © 2011 IEEE.","local monitoring; malicious nodes.; Sensor networks; sleep/wake techniques; wake-up antenna","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Monitoring; Power management (telecommunication); Scheduling; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Sleep research; Wakes; Energy constrained systems; Local monitoring; Malicious nodes; Multihop wireless; Security algorithm; Sleep-wake scheduling; Sleep/wake; Wake up; Network security",,,,,"Zhang, W., Cao, G., DCTC: Dynamic convoy tree-based collaboration for target tracking in sensor networks (2004) IEEE Trans.

For example, this includes machines that are infected by a software virus. We introduce a new cryptographic notion that we call a one-time computable pseudorandom function (PRF), which is a PRF FK (·) that can be evaluated on at most one input, even by an adversary who controls the device storing the key K, as long as: (1) the adversary cannot ""leak"" the key K out of the device completely (this is similar to the assumptions made in the Bounded-Retrieval Model), and (2) the local read/write memory of the machine is restricted, and not too much larger than the size of K. In particular, the only way to evaluate FK(x) on such device, is to overwrite part of the key K during the computation, thus preventing all future evaluations of F K (·) at any other point x′≠x. We show that this primitive can be used to construct schemes for password protected storage that are secure against dictionary attacks, even by a virus that infects the machine. Our constructions rely on the random-oracle model, and lower-bounds for graphs pebbling problems. We show that our techniques can also be used to construct another primitive, called uncomputable hash functions, which are hash functions that have a short description but require a large amount of space to compute on any input. We show that this tool can be used to improve the communication complexity of proofs-of-erasure schemes, introduced recently by Perito and Tsudik (ESORICS 2010). © 2011 International Association for Cryptologic Research.",,"Computer viruses; Hash functions; Communication complexity; Cryptographic schemes; Dictionary attack; Large amounts; Protected storage; Pseudorandom functions; Random Oracle model; Retrieval models; Function evaluation",,,,,"Akavia, A., Goldwasser, S., Vaikuntanathan, V., Simultaneous hardcore bits and cryptography against memory attacks (2009) LNCS, 5444, pp. 474-495. , Reingold, O.

Unfortunately, DHT-based systems have been shown to be notoriously difficult to protect against security attacks. Various reports have been published that discuss or classify general security issues, but so far a comprehensive survey describing the various proposed defenses has been lacking. In this article, we present an overview of techniques reported in the literature for making DHT-based systems resistant to the three most important attacks that can be launched by malicious nodes participating in the DHT: (1) the Sybil attack, (2) the Eclipse attack, and (3) routing and storage attacks. We review the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed solutions and, in doing so, confirm how difficult it is to secure DHT-based systems in an adversarial environment. © 2011 ACM.","Distributed hash tables; Eclipse attack; Peer-to-peer systems; Secure P2P routing and storage; Sybil attack","Distributed Hash Table; Eclipse attack; Peer-to-peer systems; Secure P2P routing and storage; Sybil attack; Computer crime; Distributed computer systems; Surveys; Telecommunication networks; Peer to peer networks",,,,,"Anderson, D.P., Fedak, G., The computational and storage potential of volunteer computing (2006) Sixth IEEE International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid, 2006.

The algorithm of the adversarial bandit problem is adapted to the context of blind dogfight. Both cases of complete and partial information about the rewards of different channels are analyzed. Performance bounds are obtained subject to arbitrary channel statistics and attack policy. Several attack strategies, namely uniformly random, selectively random and maximal interception attacks, are discussed. The validity of the defense strategy is then demonstrated by numerical simulation results. © 2011 IEEE.","adversarial bandit algorithm; Cognitive radio; primary user emulation attack","adversarial bandit algorithm; Attack strategies; Bandit problems; Channel statistics; Cognitive radio; Defense strategy; Interception attack; Numerical simulation; Partial information; Performance bounds; primary user emulation attack; Unknown channel; Algorithms; Cognitive systems; Computer simulation; Radio systems; Radio",,,,,"Anand, S., Jin, Z., Subbalakshmi, K.P., An analytical model for primary user emulation attacks in cognitive radio networks (2008) Proc.
